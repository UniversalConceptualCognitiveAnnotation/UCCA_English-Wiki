# text = Steven Loeb of Southampton Patch wrote , " This film has brought the best out of von Trier , as well as his star . Dunst is so good in this film , playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted ... Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is , Dunst ’s performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it . " Sukhdev Sandhu wrote from Cannes in The Daily Telegraph that " Dunst is exceptional , so utterly convincing in the lead role – trouble , serene , a fierce savant – that it feels like a career breakthrough .
