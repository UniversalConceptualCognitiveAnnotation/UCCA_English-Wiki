# text = John Gielgud directed Twelfth Night and wrote , " ... perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play , especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship ( who is brainier than he but not a born actress ) out of her timidity and safeness . He dares too confidently ... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice . " In 1955 , Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak 's film The Deep Blue Sea , costarring Kenneth More who felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming .
