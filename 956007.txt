Gone with the Wind brought Leigh immediate attention and fame ; but she was quoted as saying , " I 'm not a film star – I 'm an actress . Being a film star – just a film star – is such a false life , lived for fake values and for publicity . Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvelous parts to play . " The film won 10 Academy Awards including an Best Actress award for Leigh , who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress .
