# text = His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus , saying " In recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation , rumour and wishful thinking ... a new record ... who would have ever thought it , who 'd have ever dreamed it ! After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants ... when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell . Today he definitely has something to say .
