# text = Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of the novel and remarked on Dunst 's performance , " The perfect contrast to take - charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst 's scene - stealing Amy , whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11 - year - old vixen than they did from grown - up Joan Bennett in 1933 . Ms . Dunst , also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire , is a little vamp with a big future . "
