# text = He has generally refused to play villains and has almost never used the word " fuck " in his films ( He 's only said that word in two films , The Protector and Burn , Hollywood , Burn ) , but in Rush Hour , in an attempt to be " cool " and imitate his partner Carter , who said " What 's up , my nigga ? " to a club of black men , he said the same thing when Carter was in another room and they all attacked him , so he had to pull out his fighting skills to beat them down and escape .
