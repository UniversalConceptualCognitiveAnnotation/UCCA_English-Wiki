# text = In 1960 , Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame , commenting , " some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress . And I thought , that was a foolish , wicked thing to say , because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me , which I simply was n't able to carry . And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices . I find it so stupid . I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him . "
