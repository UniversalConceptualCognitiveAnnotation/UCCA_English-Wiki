# text = While shooting Gia , she told her then - husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him : " I 'd tell him : ' I 'm alone ; I 'm dying ; I 'm gay ; I 'm not going to see you for weeks . ' " After Gia wrapped in 1997 , Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good , because she felt that she had " nothing else to give . " She separated from Miller and moved to New York , where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes ; she later described it as " just good for me to collect myself . " Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia , she resumed her career .
