# text = In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone , Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was " the biggest mistake I ever made " and " I was always a closet heterosexual " . On other occasions , he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings ; as described by Buckley , he said he had been driven more by " a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being " .
