# text = On " Call Me Back Again " , according to Benitez , " McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist " while MacDonald called " I 'm Down " " a rock - and - roll classic " that " illustrates McCartney 's vocal and stylistic versatility " . MacDonald described " Helter Skelter " as an early attempt at heavy metal , and " Hey Jude " as a " pop / rock hybrid " , pointing out McCartney 's " use of gospel - style melismas " in the song and his " pseudo - soul shrieking in the fade - out " . Benitez identified " Hope of Deliverance " and " Put It There " as examples of McCartney 's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered " When I 'm Sixty-Four " and " Honey Pie " attempts at vaudeville .
