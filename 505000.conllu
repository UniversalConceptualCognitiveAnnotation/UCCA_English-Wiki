# text = Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) ( 1980 ) produced the number one hit " Ashes to Ashes " , featuring the textural work of guitar - synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from " Space Oddity " . The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club " Blitz " — the main New Romantic hangout — to recruit several of the regulars ( including Steve Strange of the band Visage ) to act in the accompanying video , renowned as one of the most innovative of all time .
