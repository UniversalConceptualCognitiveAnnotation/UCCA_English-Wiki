# text = The film transposed the famous William Shakespeare play to contemporary New York City , a technique Hawke felt made the play more " accessible and vital " . Salon reviewer wrote : " Hawke certainly is n't the greatest Hamlet of living memory ... but his performance reinforces Hamlet 's place as Shakespeare 's greatest character . And in that sense , he more than holds his own in the long line of actors who 've played the part .
