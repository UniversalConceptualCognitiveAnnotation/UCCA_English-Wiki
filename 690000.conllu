# text = The thing about rock ' n ' roll is that for me anyway it was n't enough ... There were great catch - phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs were n't serious or did n't reflect life in a realistic way . I knew that when I got into folk music , it was more of a serious type of thing . The songs are filled with more despair , more sadness , more triumph , more faith in the supernatural , much deeper feelings .
