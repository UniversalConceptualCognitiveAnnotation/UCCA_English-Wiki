Ron Wynn from Allmusic described Carey 's different form of singing on the album : " It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach , but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion . " The album 's second single , " Hero " , would eventually come to be one of Carey 's most popular and inspirational songs of her career .
