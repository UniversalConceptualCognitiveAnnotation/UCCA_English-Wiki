# text = Brooks Atkinson for The New York Times wrote : " Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all . " While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier 's acting and direction , Leigh was also criticised , with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the " thin , shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh 's voice . " The couple had invested almost their entire savings into the project , and the failure was a financial disaster for them .
