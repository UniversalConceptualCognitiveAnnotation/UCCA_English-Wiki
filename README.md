The UCCA Wikipedia Corpus
=========================
Version 1.2 (January 1, 2016)
-----------------------------

This bundle contains 367 passages annotated according to the foundational layer of UCCA. 
The passages are given as xmls in a format which is described below. The total number of tokens 
in this corpus is 158433. It also contains the annotation guidelines that were given to the annotators,
a metadata file and a toy example XML.

The dataset is a part of the UCCA project developed in the NLP lab of the Hebrew University 
by Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport. The users of this dataset are kindly requested to cite [the following publication](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P13-1023):
