# ::tok On 18 April 2009 , during a panel discussion at the annual Boao Forum for Asia titled " Tapping into Asia 's Creative Industry Potential , " Chan said " ... in the 10 years after Hong Kong 's return to Chinese rule , I can gradually see , I 'm not sure if it 's good to have freedom or not . " Chan went on to say , " If you 're too free , you 're like the way Hong Kong is now . It 's very chaotic . Taiwan is also chaotic . " He also added , " I 'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled . If we 're not being controlled , we 'll just do what we want . " Chan however complained about the quality of Chinese goods , saying , " ... a Chinese TV might explode . " but refrained from criticising the Chinese government for banning his 2009 film Shinjuku Incident .
