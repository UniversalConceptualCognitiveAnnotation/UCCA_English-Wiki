( His parents chose " his kooky name " — he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years — after the Greek word zoe , life . ) Elsewhere , the album explored more serious themes , and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with " Song for Bob Dylan " , " Andy Warhol " , and " Queen Bitch " , a Velvet Underground pastiche .
