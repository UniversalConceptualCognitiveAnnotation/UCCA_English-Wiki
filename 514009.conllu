# text = Buckley 's view of the period is that Bowie , " a taboo - breaker and a dabbler ... mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock " , and that " it is probably true that Bowie was never gay , nor even consistently actively bisexual ... he did , from time to time , experiment , even if only out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the ' transgressional ' . " Biographer Christopher Sandford says that according to Mary Finnigan , with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969 , the singer and his first wife Angie " lived in a fantasy world ... and they created their bisexual fantasy .
