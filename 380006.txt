When asked about such gossip during an interview , Gyllenhaal said : You know it 's flattering when there 's a rumor that says I 'm bisexual . It means I can play more kinds of roles . I 'm open to whatever people want to call me . I 've never really been attracted to men sexually , but I do n't think I would be afraid of it if it happened .
