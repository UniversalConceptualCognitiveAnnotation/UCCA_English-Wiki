# text = The Guardian was especially critical , describing the music as " afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo " , and adding that the piece has " little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole " . The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he stated , " happily , history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work .
