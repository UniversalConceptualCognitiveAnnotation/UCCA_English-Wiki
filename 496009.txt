The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park , later immortalised by Bowie in his song " Memory of a Free Festival " . Bowie 's second album , Space Oddity , followed in November ; originally issued in the UK as David Bowie , it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name , and the early US release was instead titled Man of Words / Man of Music .
