# text = Interesting . [ Long pause ] I do n't think it was a mistake in Europe , but it was a lot tougher in America . I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual . But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people . I knew what I wanted to be , which was a songwriter and a performer , and I felt that bisexuality became my headline over here for so long . America is a very puritanical place , and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do .
