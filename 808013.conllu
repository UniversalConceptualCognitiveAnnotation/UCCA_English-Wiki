# text = As Paul remembers , " The night Linda and I met , I spotted her across a crowded club , and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up , I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night ! " Linda said this about their meeting : " I was quite shameless really . I was with somebody else [ that night ] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room . He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up . " The pair married in 1969 .
