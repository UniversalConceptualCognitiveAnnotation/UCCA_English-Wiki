# text = In his acceptance speech Hawke said " I do n't know why they 're honoring me . I think the real reason they are honoring me is to help raise money for the theater company . Whenever the economy gets hit hard , one of the first thing [ sic ] to go is people 's giving , and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it 's not essential . I guess I 'm here to remind people that the arts are essential to our mental health as a country . "
