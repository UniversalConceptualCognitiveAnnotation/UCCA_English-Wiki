# ::tok When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the Sgt . Pepper cover , McCartney replied , " Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we did n't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer , he was Elvis the King . " McCartney stated that for his bassline for " I Saw Her Standing There " , he directly quoted Berry 's " I 'm Talking About You " .
