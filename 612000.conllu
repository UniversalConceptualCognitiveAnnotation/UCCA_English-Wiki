# text = Largely a self - taught musician , McCartney 's approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as " by nature drawn to music 's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ... [ he ] produced technically ' finished ' work almost entirely by instinct , his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [ A ] natural melodist — a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony " . McCartney commented , " I prefer to think of my approach to music as ... rather like the primitive cave artists , who drew without training . "
