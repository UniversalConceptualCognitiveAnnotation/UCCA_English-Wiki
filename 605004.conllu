# text = Of his first two post - Beatles tours , McCartney said , " The main thing I did n't want was to come on stage , faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads , all looking at me and saying , ' Oh well , he is not as good as he was . ' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else , so we went into Europe . "
