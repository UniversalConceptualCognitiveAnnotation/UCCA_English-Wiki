# text = Williams was pleased with the performance , writing , " Kate is a playwright 's dream actress . She makes dialogue sound better than it is by a matchless beauty and clarity of diction " . He wrote The Night of the Iguana ( 1961 ) with Hepburn in mind , but the actress , although flattered , felt the play was wrong for her and declined the part , which went to Bette Davis .
