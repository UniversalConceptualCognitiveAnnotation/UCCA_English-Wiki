# ::tok McCartney had this to say on the groups 's formation : " Wings were always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow [ the Beatles ' ] success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position . However , it was a choice between going on or finishing , and I loved music too much to think of stopping . " In September 1971 , the McCartneys ' daughter Stella was born , named in honour of Linda 's grandmothers , both of whom were named Stella .
