In a 2002 interview , Depp stated that he believed he has Native American ancestry ; in 2011 , he specified , " I guess I have some Native American [ in me ] somewhere down the line . My great - grandmother was quite a bit of Native American , she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian . Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky , which is rife with Cherokee and Creek . " The family moved frequently during Depp 's childhood , and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations , settling in Miramar , Florida , in 1970 .
