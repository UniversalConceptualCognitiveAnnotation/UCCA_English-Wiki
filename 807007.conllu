# text = In 2008 , he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said , " Here 's the deal : my father was born in Everton , my family are officially Evertonians , so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two , I would have to support Everton . But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish , who had been to the gig and I thought ' You know what ? I am just going to support them both because it 's all Liverpool . ' "
