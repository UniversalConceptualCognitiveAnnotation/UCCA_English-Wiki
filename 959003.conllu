# text = When the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949 , J . B . Priestley denounced the play and Leigh 's performance ; and the critic Kenneth Tynan commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were " too well - bred to emote effectively on stage " . Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious and sensationalist story , rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned ; but the play also had strong supporters , among them Noël Coward who described Leigh as " magnificent . "
