546009	As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, "Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers."
546010	In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, "The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse," a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions.
546011	Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece.
546012	As Thomas noted, "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros."
546013	Jack Warner's tumultuous relationship with his brother, Harry, worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack's decision to sell the Warner Bros.' pre-1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million. (
546014	The deal did not include the black-and-white Looney Tunes films, the first Merrie Melodie film, Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, and the color cartoons released between August 1, 1948, and the close of 1949.
546015	The black-and-white cartoons and the silent films were sold to Guild Films under license of Sunset Productions, which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as Columbia Pictures' Screen Gems, and the aforementioned 1948–1949 color cartoons remained with Warner Brothers). "This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone," Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal.
546016	The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year.
546017	In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market.
546018	Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company.
546019	By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother's dealings, it was too late.
546020	Jack, as the company's largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president.
546021	Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be "directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible". The two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, "I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch" and threatening to kill him.
546022	This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry; he never spoke to Jack again.
546023	When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack avoided the funeral and departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes.
546024	Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, "I didn't give a shit about Harry."
546025	At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.
547000	In the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes.
547001	In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical, My Fair Lady, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million.
547002	The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor's gross profits "plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract."
547003	Despite the "outrageous" purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros.,
547004	securing the studio $12 million in profits.
547005	Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza on Broadway and the London Stage, for Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated.
547006	However, the film won the best-picture Academy Award for 1964.
547007	In 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage.
547008	From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy.
547009	Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit.
547010	Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him "uneasy". "I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," Valenti wrote.
547011	Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white.
547012	These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an "Adults only" label and restrict tickets sales accordingly.
547013	At this, the MPAA, wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker, gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively.
547014	Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike.
547015	It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.
548000	Despite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966.
548001	Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio.
548002	Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement.
548003	His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order.
548004	Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot.
548005	The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million (equivalent to $165 million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, "Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?"
548006	At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures' Harry Cohn.
548007	Warner's decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted.
548008	He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who "sought scapegoats for dwindling profits". Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become "more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films", a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul.
548009	By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed.
548010	Evidence of Warner's eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially "hated". Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles.
548011	Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project's critical – and commercial – failure.
548012	Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner's ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay's length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film's unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong.
548013	Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.
549000	Warner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s.
549001	to run some of the company's distributions and exhibition division.
549002	Among his last productions was another film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776.
549003	Before the film's release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of two songs that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War.
549004	Without consulting the film's director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited.
549005	In November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters.
549006	Faced with a polarized political climate Americans, few were drawn to "a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics". Warner's efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive.
549007	During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against "pinko communists". This proved to be Warner's first and last television interview.
549008	On October 14, 1914, Warner married Irma Solomons, the adolescent daughter of one of San Francisco's pioneer Jewish families.
549009	Irma Warner gave birth to the couple's only child, Jack M. Warner on March 27, 1916.
549010	Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Ashkenazi Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives.
549011	Although his son bore a different middle initial, he "has been called Junior all his life". The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page.
549012	Together, Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara.
549013	Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce (a scandalous move at the time) on the grounds of desertion.
549014	Jack's older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, "Thank God our mother didn't live to see this". Warner married Ann after the divorce.
549015	The Warners, who took Irma's side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member.
549016	In the wake of this falling out, Jack's relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained.
550000	In the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days.
550001	On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner's Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan.
550002	Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact.
550003	Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized.
550004	In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying.
550005	Then, during a visit to his father's hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents' divorce.
550006	When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son's behavior, and their "tenuous" relationship came to an end.
550007	On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.'s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company.
550008	When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry.
550009	The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father's 1964 autobiography.
550010	Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
550011	The most enduring of these "girlfriends" was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a "startling" resemblance to Warner's second wife.
550012	The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair.
550013	Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast.
550014	In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side.
550015	In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak."
551000	An ardent Republican, Jack Warner nevertheless supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the early 1930s.
551001	Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany, overlooking ideological differences with those who held leftist political views.
551002	In 1947, however, Warner served as a "friendly witness" for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a "Red" infiltration of Hollywood.
551003	Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio's month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers.
551004	Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw.
551005	As one biographer observed, Warner "was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression". Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner's response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who "feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry". Warner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in The New York Times "to proclaim why Nixon should be elected". In the wake of Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president-elect.
551006	Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan's book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy's exploits during World War II. "
551007	I don't think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon," Warner said later. "I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody."
551008	In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.
552000	By the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented.
552001	Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his own office, Warner retired.
552002	In 1974, the former studio chief suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled.
552003	During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak and became unresponsive to friends and relatives.
552004	Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (edema) on September 9.
552005	He was 86 years old.
552006	A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged.
552007	He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California.
552008	Jack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million.
552009	Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann.
552010	Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr.,
552011	perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will.
552012	In the days following Warner's death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of "the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nicklelodeons" and went on to revolutionize American cinema.
552013	A front-page story in Warner's adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family's pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father's business when he was only seven years old.
552014	The late movie [ mogul ] was widely eulogized for his role in "shaping Hollywood's 'Golden Age'". Several months after Warner's death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California.
552015	The event, called "The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner", drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds, and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc.
552016	Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig's famous farewell, "A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that's all, folks."
552017	In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry, Jack Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard.
552018	He is also represented on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto, which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields.
585000	John Christopher "Johnny" Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, film producer, and musician.
585001	He has won the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor.
585002	Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street, becoming a teen idol.
585003	Dissatisfied with that status, Depp turned to film for more challenging roles; he played the title character of the acclaimed Edward Scissorhands (1990) and later found box office success in films such as Sleepy Hollow (1999), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Alice in Wonderland (2010), Rango (2011) and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series (2003–present). He has collaborated with director and friend Tim Burton in eight films; the most recent being Dark Shadows (2012). Depp has gained acclaim for his portrayals of such people as Ed Wood in Ed Wood, Joseph D. Pistone in Donnie Brasco, Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, George Jung in Blow, and the bank robber John Dillinger in Michael Mann's Public Enemies.
585004	Films featuring Depp have grossed over $3.1billion at the United States box office and over $7.6 billion worldwide.
585005	He has been nominated for top awards many times, winning the Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and from the Screen Actors Guild for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
585006	He also has garnered a sex symbol status in American cinema, being twice named as the "Sexiest Man Alive" by People magazine in 2003 and 2009.
585007	He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records as the highest paid actor, with $75million.
585008	Depp was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, and raised in Florida, as the youngest of four children of Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.
585009	The two divorced when Johnny was 15.
585010	The BBC genealogical TV program Who Do You Think You Are?, traced Depp's family name, Deppes, to 14th-century French Huguenots living in England.
585011	In a 2002 interview, Depp stated that he believed he has Native American ancestry; in 2011, he specified, "I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek."
585012	The family moved frequently during Depp's childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970.
585013	In 1978, Depp's parents divorced.
585014	His mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called "an inspiration to me". Depp engaged in self-harm when he was young, due to the stress of dealing with family problems, which resulted in several self-inflicted scars.
585015	In a 1993 interview, he reflected on his self-injury by saying "My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist".
590000	Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price.
590001	His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood.
590002	Depp later said that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed."
590003	At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking.
590004	This part gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun"; he said working with Landau "rejuvenated my love for acting". Producer Scott Rudin once said, "Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies," although Burton personally disapproved of the comment.
590005	Depp, however agrees with Rudin's statement.
590006	According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton's inability to communicate as a teenager.
590007	Ed Wood reflected Burton's relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi). Depp's next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci.
590008	Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton's battle with the Hollywood studio system.
590009	For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone.
590010	Depp stated, "I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl."
590011	Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in which he played Willy Wonka.
590012	Depp modeled the character's hair on Anna Wintour.
590013	The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception.
590014	Gene Wilder, who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film, initially criticized this version.
590015	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride, for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September.
590016	Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
590017	Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000.
590018	Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale's treatment.
590019	He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.
590020	Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim's lyrics.
590021	Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach.
590022	In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, "Depp's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met."
590023	In his introduction to Burton on Burton, a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton "...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman.
590024	In 2012, he starred in the Burton-directed film Dark Shadows, a based on the 1966–1971 gothic soap opera of the same name, alongside fellow Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green.
633000	The Beatles evolved from Lennon's first band, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by him in September 1956 when he was 15, and began as a skiffle group.
633001	By the summer of 1957 the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.
633002	Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter's Church garden fête, after which McCartney was asked to join the band.
633003	McCartney says that Aunt Mimi: "was very aware that John's friends were lower class", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.
633004	According to Paul's brother Mike, McCartney's father was also disapproving, declaring Lennon would get his son "into trouble"; although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys' front room at 20 Forthlin Road.
633005	During this time, the 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, "Hello Little Girl", a UK top 10 hit for The Fourmost nearly five years later.
633006	George Harrison joined the band as lead guitarist, even though Lennon thought Harrison (at 14 years old) was too young to join the band, so McCartney engineered a second audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played "Raunchy" for Lennon.
633007	Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.
633008	Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became "The Beatles" in early 1960.
633009	In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany, and desperately in need of a drummer, asked Pete Best to join them.
633010	Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead.
633011	After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962.
633012	Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.
634000	Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager from 1962, had no prior experience of artist management, but nevertheless had a strong influence on their early dress code and attitude on stage.
634001	Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and drummer Ringo Starr replaced Best, completing the four-piece line-up that would endure until the group's break-up in 1970.
634002	The band's first single, "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts.
634003	They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, Twist and Shout.
634004	The Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks.
634005	With few exceptions - one being the album title itself - Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that - to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: "He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest". The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK during the beginning of 1963.
634006	Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April.
634007	During their Royal Variety Show performance, attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: "For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands ... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery."
634008	After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom.
634009	A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works.
634010	The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1965.
635000	Lennon grew concerned that fans attending Beatles' concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result.
635001	Lennon's "Help!" expressed his own feelings in 1965: "I meant it ... It was me singing 'help'". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his "Fat Elvis" period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.
635002	The following January he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug.
635003	When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects.
635004	Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: "We were all screaming ... hot and hysterical."
635005	A few months later in March, during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon remarked, "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink ... We're more popular than Jesus now-I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity."
635006	The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later.
635007	The furore that followed-burning of Beatles' records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon-contributed to the band's decision to stop touring.
635008	Deprived of the routine of live performances after their final commercial concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon felt lost and considered leaving the band.
635009	Since his involuntary introduction to LSD in January, he had made increasing use of the drug, and was almost constantly under its influence for much of the year.
635010	According to biographer Ian MacDonald, Lennon's continuous experience with LSD during the year brought him "close to erasing his identity". 1967 saw the release of "Strawberry Fields Forever", hailed by Time magazine for its "astonishing inventiveness", and the group's landmark album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which revealed Lennon's lyrics contrasting strongly with the simple love songs of the Lennon-McCartney's early years.
636000	In August, after having been introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the group attended a weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales, and were informed of Epstein's death during the seminar. "
636001	I knew we were in trouble then", Lennon said later. "I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared". They later travelled to Maharishi's ashram in India for further guidance, where they composed most of the songs for The Beatles and Abbey Road.
636002	The anti-war, black comedy How I Won the War, featuring Lennon's only appearance in a non-Beatles' full-length film, was shown in cinemas in October 1967.
636003	McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, released in December that year.
636004	While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its soundtrack release, featuring Lennon's acclaimed, Lewis Carroll-inspired "I Am the Walrus", was a success.
636005	With Epstein gone, the band members became increasingly involved in business activities, and in February 1968 they formed Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies.
636006	Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve, "artistic freedom within a business structure", but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with Yoko Ono, and McCartney's own marriage plans, left Apple in need of professional management.
636007	Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records.
636008	Lennon approached Allen Klein, who had managed The Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion.
636009	Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract.
636010	At the end of 1968, Lennon featured in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (not released until 1996) in the role of a Dirty Mac band member.
636011	The supergroup, composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell, also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film.
636012	Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called "Bag One" depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated.
636013	Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins (known more for its cover than for its music), Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions and Wedding Album.
636014	In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969.
636015	In protest at Britain's involvement in the Nigerian Civil War, Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen, though this had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced.
636016	Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles "Give Peace a Chance" (widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam-War anthem in 1969), "Cold Turkey" (documenting his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin) and "Instant Karma!".
637000	Lennon left the group in September 1969, and agreed not to inform the media while the band renegotiated their recording contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970.
637001	Lennon's reaction was, "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!"
637002	He later wrote, "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that."
637003	In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record."
637004	He spoke too of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?"
637005	In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Dr. Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California.
637006	Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London.
637007	Lennon's emotional debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with high praise.
637008	Critic Greil Marcus remarked, "John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock."
637009	The album featured the songs "Mother", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque "Working Class Hero", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric "you're still fucking peasants", fell foul of broadcasters.
637010	The same year, Tariq Ali's revolutionary political views, expressed when he interviewed Lennon, inspired the singer to write "Power to the People". Lennon also became involved with Ali during a protest against Oz magazine's prosecution for alleged obscenity.
637011	Lennon denounced the proceedings as "disgusting fascism", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single "God Save Us/Do the Oz" and joined marches in support of the magazine.
638000	Sample of "Imagine", Lennon's "most famous post-Beatles' track."
638001	Like "Give Peace a Chance", the song became an anti-war anthem, but its lyrics offended religious groups.
638002	Lennon's explanation was, "If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion-not without religion, but without this 'my God is bigger than your God' thing-then it can be true."
638003	With Lennon's next album, Imagine (1971), critical response was more guarded.
638004	Rolling Stone reported that "it contains a substantial portion of good music" but warned of the possibility that "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant". The album's title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, "How Do You Sleep?", was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from Ram that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono.
638005	However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written "How Do You Sleep?" about himself.
638006	He said in 1980: "I used my resentment against Paul... to create a song... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't really go' round with those thoughts in my head all the time". Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971, and in December released "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)". The new year saw the Nixon Administration take what it called a "strategic counter-measure" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda, embarking on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him.
638007	In 1972, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin after McGovern lost to Nixon.
638008	Embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, Lennon was denied permanent residency in the US (which wouldn't be resolved until 1976). Depressed, Lennon got intoxicated and had sex with a female guest, leaving Ono embarrassed.
638009	Her song "Death of Samantha" was inspired by the incident.
639000	Recorded as a collaboration with Ono and with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory, Some Time in New York City was released in 1972.
639001	Containing songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's problems obtaining a green card, the album was poorly received-unlistenable, according to one critic. "
639002	Woman Is the Nigger of the World", released as a US single from the album the same year, was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show.
639003	Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word "nigger". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility.
639004	Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances.
639005	While Lennon was recording Mind Games (1973), he and Ono decided to separate.
639006	The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his "lost weekend", was spent in Los Angeles and New York in the company of May Pang.
639007	Mind Games, credited to the "Plastic U.F.Ono Band", was released in November 1973.
639008	Lennon also contributed "I'm the Greatest", to Starr's album Ringo (1973), released the same month. (
639009	An alternate take, from the same 1973 Ringo sessions, with Lennon providing a guide vocal, appears on John Lennon Anthology). In early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with Harry Nilsson made headlines.
639010	Two widely publicised incidents occurred at The Troubadour club in March, the first when Lennon placed a menstruation "towel" on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress, and the second, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers.
639011	Lennon decided to produce Nilsson's album Pussy Cats and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians but after a month of further debauchery, with the recording sessions in chaos, Lennon moved to New York with Pang to finish work on the album.
639012	In April, Lennon had produced the Mick Jagger song "Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)" which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years.
639013	Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on The Very Best of Mick Jagger (2007).
640000	Settled back in New York, Lennon recorded the album Walls and Bridges. Released in October 1974, it yielded his only number-one non-Beatles single in his lifetime, "Whatever Gets You Thru the Night", featuring Elton John on backing vocals and piano.
640001	A second single from the album, "#9 Dream", followed before the end of the year.
640002	Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano.
640003	On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving concert at Madison Square Garden, in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if "Whatever Gets You Thru the Night"-a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted-reached number one.
640004	Lennon performed the song along with "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "I Saw Her Standing There", which he introduced as "a song by an old estranged fiancée of mine called Paul". Lennon co-wrote "Fame", David Bowie's first US number one, and provided guitar and backing vocals for the January 1975 recording.
640005	The same month, Elton John topped the charts with his cover of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", featuring Lennon on guitar and back-up vocals (Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of "Dr. Winston O'Boogie"). He and Ono were reunited shortly afterwards. Lennon released Rock 'n' Roll (1975), an album of cover songs, in February. "
640006	Stand by Me", taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years.
640007	He made what would be his final stage appearance in the ATV special A Salute to Lew Grade, recorded on 18 April and televised in June.
640008	Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from Rock 'n' Roll ("Stand By Me", which was not broadcast, and "Slippin' and Slidin'") followed by "Imagine". The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon who thought Grade was two-faced.
641000	With the birth of his second son Sean on 9 October 1975, Lennon took on the role of househusband, beginning what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry during which he gave all his attention to his family.
641001	Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks.
641002	He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6 am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him.
641003	He wrote "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980.
641004	He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family."
641005	During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed "mad stuff", all of which would be published posthumously.
641006	Lennon emerged from retirement in October 1980 with the single "(Just Like) Starting Over", followed the next month by the album Double Fantasy, which contained songs written during a journey to Bermuda on a 43-foot sailing boat the previous June, that reflected his fulfilment in his new-found stable family life.
641007	Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album Milk and Honey (released posthumously in 1984). Released jointly with Ono, Double Fantasy was not well received, drawing comments such as Melody Maker's " indulgent sterility... a godawful yawn". At around 10:50 pm on 8 December 1980, as Lennon and Ono returned to their New York apartment in The Dakota, Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in the back four times at the entrance to the building.
641008	Lennon was taken to the emergency room of nearby Roosevelt Hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:07 pm.
641009	Earlier that evening, Lennon had autographed a copy of Double Fantasy for Chapman.
657000	Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, and philanthropist.
657001	Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, Carey released her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.
657002	Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993 and success with hit records Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), Carey was established as Columbia's highest-selling act.
657003	Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single "One Sweet Day", a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history.
657004	During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop.
657005	This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola.
657006	Carey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records.
657007	Before the release of her first feature film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion.
657008	Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career.
657009	She signed a multi-million dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single "We Belong Together" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named "Song of the Decade" by Billboard.
657010	Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received starring role in Precious (2009); she was awarded the "Breakthrough Performance Award" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and Black Reel and NAACP Image Award multi nominations
658000	In a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
658001	In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards.
658002	Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000.
658003	According to the Recording Industry Association of America, she is the third best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums.
658004	With the release of "Touch My Body" (2008), Carey gained her eighteenth number one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist.
658005	In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Women in Music". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five Grammy Awards, 17 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards, and 31 Billboard Music Awards.
658006	Referred to as the "songbird supreme" by the Guinness World Records, she is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.
658007	Mariah Carey was born in Northport, New York, on March 27, 1970.
658008	Her father, Alfred Roy, was of African American and Venezuelan (including Afro-Venezuelan) descent, while her mother, Patricia (née Hickey), is of white Irish descent.
658009	The last name Carey was the product of a name-change by her Venezuelan grandfather Francisco Nuñez after emigrating to New York.
658010	Patricia's father had died while she was young; however, she inherited his passion for music.
658011	She developed a career as an occasional opera singer and vocal coach, and met Alfred in 1960.
658012	As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York.
658013	After the pair's elopement, Patricia's family disowned her, due to marrying a man of color.
658014	Carey later explained that growing up, she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family, a mark that affected her greatly: "So later I was like, 'Well, where does this leave me? Am I a bad person?' You know. It's still not that common to be a multi-racial person, but I'm happy with the combination of things that I am."
658015	During the interval of years in between Carey's older sister Alison and the singer's birth, the Carey family experienced personal struggles within the community due to their ethnicity.
658016	Carey's name was derived from the song "They Call the Wind Mariah", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.
658017	When Carey was three years old, her parents divorced due to the increasingly strenuous nature of their marriage.
659000	After their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children remained with their mother.
659001	As the years passed, Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether.
659002	By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing from her heart, and try and find peace within the music.
659003	During elementary school, she would excel in subjects that she enjoyed, such as literature, art and music, while not finding interest in other subjects.
659004	After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York.
659005	Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a singer-songwriter while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York.
659006	Even from a young age, Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the whistle register, though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother.
659007	Though introducing her daughter to the world of classical opera, Patricia never pressured Carey to pursue a career in the genre, as she never seemed interested in that world of music.
659008	Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel'. I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me."
659009	While a high school student, Carey developed a relationship with Gavin Christopher, with whom she shared musical aspirations.
659010	The songwriting duo needed an assistant who could play the keyboard: "We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well - he was really more of a drummer - but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers."
659011	Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's senior year.
659012	After composing their first song together, "Here We Go Round Again", which Carey described as having a Motown-vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo.
659013	Following her graduation from high school, Carey's mother remarried, which ultimately prompted her to move out from their apartment.
659014	She began living in a one bedroom studio in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.
659015	During this time, Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two-week intervals.
659016	While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey's mind and effort still remained with her musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies, in hopes of completing a demo that could be passed on to record executives.
659017	After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but was met with failure each time.
659018	Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising pop singer Brenda K. Starr.
66000	Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand.
660000	As Carey's friendship with Starr grew, so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry.
660001	On a Friday night in December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives gala, where she handed her demo tape to Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia Records, who listened to it on his way back home.
660002	After the first two songs, he became so enamored at the sound and quality of Carey's voice that he turned around and returned to the event, only to find that she had left.
660003	In what has been widely described by critics as a modern day Cinderella-like tale, after searching for Carey for two weeks, and eventually contacting her through Starr's management, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her debut into mainstream music.
660004	While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.
660005	Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as the main female pop artist on their roster, competing with the likes of Whitney Houston and Madonna, who were signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively.
660006	After the completion of her debut album, titled Mariah Carey, Columbia spent an upward of $1 million to promote it.
660007	Though opening with weak sales, the album eventually reached the top of the Billboard 200, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd annual Grammy Awards.
660008	Mariah Carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks, and she won the Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single "Vision of Love". The album yielded an additional three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, following the four-week number-one run of "Vision of Love". Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles reach number one.
660009	Mariah Carey finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991, while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.
66001	She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.
66002	On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent, and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.
66003	Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois; her only known Native ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649.
66004	After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.
66005	As a child, Jolie regularly saw movies with her mother and later explained that this had inspired her interest in acting; she had not been influenced by her father.
66006	When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later.
66007	She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.
66008	At the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director.
66009	She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London.
66010	During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.
66011	Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.
66012	She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heart - and always will be - just a punk kid with tattoos."
661000	Carey began recording her second studio album, eventually titled Emotions, in 1991.
661001	The album, as Carey described it, paid homage to Motown soul music, as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music and genre that truly influenced her as a struggling child.
661002	For the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Clivillés and Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory.
661003	However, Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well.
661004	However, when the time came to write music for Emotions, Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album.
661005	Subsequently, Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways.
661006	On September 17, 1991, Emotions was released around the world, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor.
661007	While praised for Carey's improved songwriting, production and new sound, the album was criticized for its material, which many felt was noticeably weaker than her debut.
661008	Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.
661009	As they had done after the release of her debut, critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour in promotion for her material.
661010	Although Carey explained that due to her stage fright, and the general strenuous nature of her songs, a tour sounded very daunting, speculation grew that Carey was a "studio worm", and that she wasn't capable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-octave vocal range for which she was known.
661011	In hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged, a television program aired by MTV.
661012	The show's purpose was to present name artists, and feature them "unplugged" or stripped of studio equipment.
661013	While Carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included.
661014	Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected.
661015	They chose "I'll Be There", a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970, rehearsing it few times before the night of the show.
661016	On March 16, 1992, Carey recorded a seven-piece set-list at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.
661017	The revue was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would.
661018	The revue's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album.
661019	Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.
661020	The EP proved to be a success, contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist, and was given a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.
662000	During early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, Music Box.
662001	After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience.
662002	During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of Music Box.
662003	During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola became romantically involved.
662004	They wed in a lavish ceremony on June 5, 1993, with several high-profile guests including Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Gloria Estefan and Ozzy Osbourne.
662005	On August 31, Music Box was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.
662006	The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range.
662007	Ron Wynn from Allmusic described Carey's different form of singing on the album: "It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion."
662008	The album's second single, "Hero", would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career.
662009	The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States, and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe.
662010	With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones.
662011	Her cover of Badfinger's "Without You" became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
662012	Music Box spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries, and eventually became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 32 million copies.
662013	After declining to tour for her past two albums, Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts, titled the Music Box Tour.
662014	Spanning only six dates across North America, the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey, who dreaded the hassle of touring.
662015	Following Music Box, Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye, and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994.
662016	The project was kept very secretive until Billboard announced on their October issue that Carey would release a holiday album later that year.
662017	In late 1994, Carey recorded a duet with Luther Vandross; a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's "Endless Love". By that point, Columbia felt Carey had already established herself as a pop singer, and vocalist, but wanted to try and feature her as more of an entertainer.
662018	Through the release of Merry Christmas, Columbia hoped that audiences would buy Carey's material solely for her name and reputation, and squash fears of her being a typical pop singer.
662019	The album was released on November 1, 1994, on the same day that the album's first single, "All I Want for Christmas Is You", was released.
662020	The album eventually became the best-selling Christmas album of all time, with global sales reaching over 15 million copies.
662021	Additionally, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" was critically lauded, and is considered "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon."
662022	Rolling Stone described it as a "holiday standard", and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list.
662023	Commercially, it became the best-selling holiday ringtone of all time, and the best-selling single by a non-Asian artist in Japan, selling over 2.1 million units (both ringtone and digital download). By the end of the holiday season of 1994, Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album, which would be released in the fall of the following year.
663000	Released on October 3, 1995, Daydream combined the pop sensibilities of Music Box with downbeat R&B and hip hop influences.
663001	The album's second single, "One Sweet Day" was inspired by the death of David Cole, as well as her sister Alison, who had contracted AIDS.
663002	The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record-breaking sixteen weeks, and became the longest running number one song in history.
663003	Daydream became her biggest-selling album in the United States, and became her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, following Music Box.
663004	The album again was the best-seller by an international artist in Japan, shipping over 2.2 million copies, and eventually reaching global sales of over 25 million units.
663005	Critically, the album was heralded as Carey's best to date; The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums, and wrote, "best cuts bring R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés."
663006	Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled Daydream World Tour.
663007	It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe.
663008	When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones.
663009	Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist.
663010	Daydream and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.
663011	Carey, along with Boyz II Men, opened the event with a performance of "One Sweet Day". However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment "What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything."
663012	In 1995, due to Daydream's enormous Japanese sales, Billboard declared Carey the "Overseas Artist of the Year" in Japan.
664000	After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time.
664001	Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, as well as his controlling nature.
664002	With each following album, and her continual established fame and popularity, Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music, and started infusing more genres into her work.
664003	During mid-1997, Carey was well underway, writing and recording material for her next album, Butterfly (1997). She sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.
664004	During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola separated, with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom, and a new lease on life.
664005	Aside from the album's different approach, critics took notice of Carey's altered style of singing, which she described as breathy vocals.
664006	Her new-found style of singing was met with mixed reception; some critics felt is was a sign of maturity, that she didn't feel the need to always show off her upper range, while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice.
664007	The album's lead single, "Honey", and its accompanying music video, introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated, and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola.
664008	Carey stated that Butterfly marked the point when she attained full creative control over her music.
664009	However, she added, "I don't think that it's that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do."
664010	Growing creative differences with producer Afanasieff continued, and eventually ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's material.
664011	Reviews for Butterfly were generally positive: Rolling Stone wrote, "It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie. [... Except "Outside" the album sounds] very 1997. [...] Carey has spread her wings and she's ready to fly."
664012	Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as "sultrier and more controlled than ever", and heralded Butterfly as her "best record and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'"
664013	The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous three albums.
665000	Toward the turn of the millennium, Carey began developing other projects, many of which she wasn't able to during her marriage.
665001	On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan and Carole King.
665002	Carey had begun developing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter, and intended her songwriting to other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.
665003	The executives at Sony Music, the parent company of Carey's label Columbia, wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the commercially favorable holiday season.
665004	However, they disagreed as to what content and singles should constitute the album.
665005	Sony wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, void of any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial.
665006	She felt that not including any new material would result in cheating her fans, therefore including four new songs that she had recorded.
665007	While compromised, Carey often expressed distaste towards the album's song selection, expressing her disappointment in the omission of her "favorite songs". The album titled, #1's (1998), featured a duet with Whitney Houston, "When You Believe", and was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998). During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song "When You Believe" for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt.
665008	In an interview with Ebony, Houston described working with Carey, as well as their growing friendship: "Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang together before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's good to know that two ladies of soul and music can still be friends." #
665009	1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, and placing as the only international artist to accomplish this feat.
665010	When describing Carey's popularity in Japan throughout the 1990s, author Chris Nickson compared it to Beatlemania in the 1960s.
665011	The album sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist, while amassing global sales of over 17 million copies.
666000	During the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label.
666001	During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career.
666002	She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained.
666003	Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.
666004	The album, titled Rainbow (1999), found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as Jay-Z and DJ Clue?.
666005	Carey also wrote two ballads with David Foster and Diane Warren, whom she seemingly used to replace Afanasieff.
666006	Rainbow was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the Billboard 200.
666007	Throughout early-2000, Carey's troubled relationship with Columbia grew, as they halted promotion after the album's first two singles.
666008	They felt Rainbow didn't have any strong single to be released, whereas Carey wanted a ballad regarding personal and inner strength released.
666009	The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" on radio stations.
666010	One of the messages Carey left on her page read: "Basically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up."
666011	Fearing to lose their label's highest seller, Sony chose to release the song.
666012	Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which made charting extremely difficult and unlikely.
666013	Critical reception of Rainbow was generally enthusiastic, with the Sunday Herald saying that the album "sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&B heavyweights like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Usher [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul."
666014	Vibe magazine expressed similar sentiments, writing, "She pulls out all stops [...] Rainbow will garner even more adoration". Though a commercial success, Rainbow became Carey's lowest selling album to that point in her career.
667000	After she received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium, Carey parted from Columbia and signed a record-breaking $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records). Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.
667001	She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting.
667002	She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives.
667003	Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown.
667004	She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked, and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended.
667005	In an interview the following year, she said, "I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that."
667006	Due to the pressure from the media, her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel, Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings.
667007	On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble.
667008	While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.
667009	Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: "I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself."
667010	Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" when she posted the letters.
668000	On July 26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown". Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.
668001	Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.
668002	Consequently, critics suggested that in delaying Glitter, hype for the project would have largely subsided, and would possibly hurt both ticket and album sales.
668003	When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11.
668004	Critics panned Glitter, as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.
668005	The accompanying soundtrack album, Glitter, became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point.
668006	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed it as "an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful."
668007	Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her unprecedented $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records (EMI Records) was bought out for $50 million.
668008	Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.
668009	Carey later said that her time at Virgin was "a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that."
668010	Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC.
668011	To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.
669000	In 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, WiseGirls, alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant.
669001	It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of Fox News referred to her as "a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium", and wrote, "Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs". Later that year, Carey performed the American national anthem to rave reviews at the Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.
669002	Towards the end of 2002, Carey released her next studio album Charmbracelet, which she said marked "a new lease on life" for her.
669003	Though released in the wake of Glitter and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism.
669004	Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album "the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos", while Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote, "What is a greater problem is that Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs."
669005	In an attempt to "relaunch" her career following the poor reception to Glitter, as well as her breakdown, Carey announced a world tour in April 2003.
669006	Lasting over eight months, the Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, became her most extensive tour to date, spanning sixty-nine shows around the world.
669007	Throughout the United States, the shows were done in smaller theaters, and something more Broadway-influenced, "It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me."
669008	However, while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe, performing for a crowd of over, 35,000, in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China.
669009	In the United Kingdom, it became Carey's first tour to feature shows outside of London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.
669010	Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.
670000	Throughout 2004, Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri, as well as Bryan-Michael Cox, Manuel Seal, The Neptunes and Kanye West.
670001	The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics.
670002	Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as "cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again", while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, "The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying."
670003	The album's second single, "We Belong Together", became a "career re-defining" song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.
670004	music critics heralded the song as her "return to form", as well as the "return of The Voice", while many felt it would revive "faith" in Carey's potential as a balladeer. "
670005	We Belong Together" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100.
670006	After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, "One Sweet Day". Billboard listed it as the "song of the decade" and the ninth most popular song of all time.
670007	Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.
670008	During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as "We Belong Together" remained at number one, and her next single, "Shake It Off" moved into the number two spot. (
670009	Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a "featured" singer on the #2 single.)
670010	On the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.
670011	Billboard listed "We Belong Together" ninth on The Billboard Hot 100-Time All All-Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard.
670012	The album earned ten Grammy Award nominations in 2006-07: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year), and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition (from which "Don't Forget About Us" became her seventeenth #1 hit). In 2006 Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi, as well as Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for "We Belong Together". The Emancipation of Mimi was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold.
670013	It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill in 1996.
670014	At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's X&Y.
670015	It was the best-selling album worldwide by a solo and female artist.
670016	To date, The Emancipation of Mimi has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.
670017	At the 48th Grammy Awards, Carey performed a medley of "We Belong Together" and "Fly Like a Bird". The performance earned the night's only standing ovation, prompting Teri Hatcher, who was presenting the next award, to exclaim, "It's like we've all just been saved!"
671000	In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a "Carey-centric fan's" music diary.
671001	The tour spanned forty stops, with thirty-two in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.
671002	Tickets for the tour went on sale on June 2, 2006, with prices ranging from $95 to $150 USD, and featured Carey's long-time friend Randy Jackson as the tour's musical director.
671003	Carey's performances consisted of old songs from her catalog as well as her newest singles.
671004	The tour received warm critical reaction from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the show as a whole.
671005	However, critics felt the show's excesses, such as Carey's often costume changes and pre-filmed clips, were unnecessary distractions.
671006	The tour proved successful, with Carey playing to over 60,000 fans in the two stops in Tunis alone.
671007	Midway through the tour, Carey booked a two-night concert engagement in Hong Kong, which was scheduled to take place following her Japanese shows.
671008	The shows were cancelled, however, after tickets went on sale.
671009	According to Carey's then-manager Benny Medina, the cancellation was due to the concert promoter's refusal to pay Carey her agreed-upon compensation.
671010	The promoter instead blamed poor ticket sales (allegedly, only 4,000 tickets had sold) and "Carey's outrageous demands". Carey ultimately sued the promoter, claiming $1 million in damages due to the concert's abrupt cancellation. "
671011	The Adventures of Mimi" DVD was released in November 2007 internationally and December 2007 in the US.
671012	By spring 2007, Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC², in a private villa in Anguilla.
671013	When asked about the album title's meaning, Carey said "Einstein's theory? Physics? Me? Hello! ...Of course I'm poking fun."
671014	She characterized it as "Emancipation of Mimi to the second power", and said that she was "freer" on this album than any other.
671015	Although E=MC² was well received by most critics, some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi.
671016	Two weeks before the album's release, "Touch My Body", the record's lead single reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.
671017	Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles.
671018	Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history."
671019	Carey has also had notable success on international charts, though not to the same degree as in the United States.
671020	Thus far, she has had two #1 singles in Britain, two in Australia, and six in Canada.
671021	Her highest-charting single in Japan peaked at number two.
104000	Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties.
104001	She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.
104002	She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm; later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."
104003	She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried "just about every drug possible," including heroin.
104004	Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father.
104005	Due to Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years.
104006	They reconciled and he appeared with her in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.
104007	In July 2002, Jolie — who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress — filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002.
104008	In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had "serious mental problems" on Access Hollywood.
104009	In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father.
104010	She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight.
104011	In the wake of her beloved mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement.
105000	When she was seven years old, Jolie had a small part in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), a movie co-written by and starring her father, Jon Voight.
105001	She committed to acting at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that she was "too dark."
105002	She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's "Stand by My Woman" (1991), Antonello Venditti's "Alta Marea" (1991), The Lemonheads's "It's About Time" (1993), and Meat Loaf's "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them.
105003	Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."
105004	Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget, straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as Casella "Cash" Reese, a near-human robot, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate.
105005	Jolie was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.
105006	Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), Jolie starred as Kate "Acid Burn" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times wrote, "Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight."
105007	The movie failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.
106000	She next appeared in the 1996 comedy Love Is All There Is, a modern-day loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York.
106001	In the road movie Mojave Moon (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer.
106002	That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film Foxfire after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them.
106003	The Los Angeles Times wrote about her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."
106004	In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld.
106005	The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that "Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is."
106006	She then appeared in the television film True Women (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle.
106007	That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for "Anybody Seen My Baby?" by the Rolling Stones.
107000	Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise.
107001	The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.
107002	Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance.
107003	In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's Gia, portraying supermodel Gia Carangi.
107004	The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s.
107005	Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal - filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation - and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."
107006	For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award.
107007	She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.
114000	Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907 - June 29, 2003) was an American actress of film, stage, and television.
114001	Known for her headstrong independence and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned more than 60 years.
114002	Her work came in a range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress-a record for any performer.
114003	Hepburn's characters were often strong, sophisticated women with a hidden vulnerability.
114004	Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College.
114005	After four years in the theatre, her favorable reviews of work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood.
114006	Her early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy Award for her third picture, Morning Glory (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures.
114007	In 1938 she was labeled "box office poison". Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story, which she sold on the condition that she be the star.
114008	In the 1940s she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy.
114009	The screen-partnership spanned 25 years, and produced nine movies.
115000	Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespeare stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles.
115001	She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced.
115002	Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s she began appearing in television movies, which became the focus of her career in later life.
115003	She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87.
115004	After a period of inactivity and ill-health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.
115005	Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to societal expectations of women.
115006	She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so.
115007	She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently.
115008	A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public.
115009	With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the "modern woman" in 20th-century America and helped change perceptions of women.
115010	In 1999, she was named by the American Film Institute as the top female Hollywood legend.
116000	Hepburn was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on May 12, 1907, the second of six children.
116001	Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879–1962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton (1878–1951), a feminist campaigner.
116002	Both fought for social change in America: Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England Social Hygiene Association, which educated the public about venereal disease, while Katharine Martha headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret Sanger.
116003	As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several "Votes For Women" demonstrations.
116004	The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished.
116005	Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered.
116006	Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of "two very remarkable parents", and credited her "enormously lucky" upbringing with providing the foundation for her success.
116007	She remained close to her family throughout her life.
116008	The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her hair short like a boy's.
116009	Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis.
116010	Golf became a passion for his oldest daughter: she took daily lessons and became very good, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship.
116011	She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you."
116012	Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night.
116013	With her friends and siblings, she would put on plays and perform to her neighbors for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.
123000	On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn discovered the body of her older brother Tom, whom she adored, dead from an apparent suicide.
123001	He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself.
123002	The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong.
123003	The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people.
123004	She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring.
123005	For many years, she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own.
123006	It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.
123007	In 1924, Hepburn gained a place at Bryn Mawr College.
123008	She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience.
123009	It was the first time she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates.
123010	She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and was once suspended for smoking in her room.
123011	Hepburn was drawn to acting but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades.
123012	Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly.
123013	The lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received, cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career.
123014	She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.
124000	Hepburn left Bryn Mawr determined to become an actress.
124001	The day after graduating, she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company.
124002	Impressed by her eagerness, Knopf cast Hepburn in his current production, The Czarina.
124003	She received good reviews for her small role; the Printed Word described her performance as "arresting". She was given a part in the following week's show, but here Hepburn was less accomplished.
124004	She was criticized for her shrill voice, and so left Baltimore to study with an acclaimed voice tutor in New York City.
124005	Knopf decided to produce The Big Pond in New York and called for Hepburn to be the understudy to the leading lady.
124006	A week before opening, the lead was fired and replaced with Hepburn, which gave her a starring role after only four weeks in the theatre.
124007	On opening night, Hepburn turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too high and fast to be comprehensible.
124008	She was promptly fired, and the original leading lady rehired.
124009	Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with producer Arthur Hopkins, and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in These Days.
124010	Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights.
124011	Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday.
124012	In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, her beau from college.
124013	She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.
125000	In 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in Death Takes a Holiday.
125001	She felt the role was perfect, but again she was fired.
125002	Hepburn went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for minimum pay in A Month in the Country.
125003	In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined a stock company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
125004	She left halfway through the summer season, and continued studying with a drama tutor.
125005	In early 1931, she was cast in the Broadway production of Art and Mrs. Bottle.
125006	She was released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying "She looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent", but then rehired when no other actress could be found.
125007	It went on to be a small success.
125008	During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie Howard.
125009	They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure this was the role to make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired.
125010	When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, "Well, to be brutally frank, you weren't very good."
125011	This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work.
125012	She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she received an offer to read for the lead role in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.
125013	The Warrior's Husband proved to be Hepburn's break-out performance.
125014	Biographer Charles Higham states that the play was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production.
125015	It opened on March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway.
125016	Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic.
125017	The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews.
125018	Richard Garland of the New York World-Telegram wrote, "It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene."
126000	A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn's appearance in The Warrior's Husband, and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement.
126001	Hepburn was unhappy with her test scene, and sent material from Holiday instead. Director George Cukor was impressed by what he saw: "There was this odd creature," he recalled, "she was unlike anybody I'd ever heard."
126002	He particularly liked the manner in which she picked up a glass: "I thought she was very talented in that action."
126003	Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown actress.
126004	Cukor encouraged the studio to accept her demands and they signed Hepburn to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee.
126005	RKO head David O. Selznick recounted that he took a "tremendous chance" in casting the unusual actress.
126006	Hepburn arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old.
126007	She starred in A Bill of Divorcement opposite John Barrymore, showing no sign of intimidation.
126008	Although she struggled to adapt to the nature of film acting, Hepburn was fascinated by the industry from the start.
126009	The picture was a success and Hepburn received rave reviews.
126010	Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called her performance "exceptionally fine ... Miss Hepburn's characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen". The Variety review declared, "Standout here is the smash impression made by Katharine Hepburn in her first picture assignment. She has a vital something that sets her apart from the picture galaxy."
126011	On the strength of A Bill of Divorcement, RKO signed the actress to a long-term contract.
126012	George Cukor became a lifetime friend and colleague-e and Hepburn made ten films together.
127000	Hepburn's second film was Christopher Strong (1933), the story of an aviatrix and her affair with a married man.
127001	The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's own reviews were good.
127002	Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal American that although her mannerisms were grating, "they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality."
127003	Her third picture confirmed Hepburn as a major actress in Hollywood.
127004	For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace in Morning Glory, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress.
127005	She had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers.
127006	Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony—as she would not for the duration of her career—but was thrilled with the win.
127007	Her success continued with the role of Jo in the screen adaptation of Little Women (1933). The movie was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival.
127008	Little Women was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, "I defy anyone to be as good as I was [as Jo]".
128000	By the end of 1933 Hepburn was at the top of her profession, but yearned to prove herself on Broadway.
128001	Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump.
128002	He asked Hepburn to appear in the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary.
128003	Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film Spitfire (1934). Hepburn's role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl.
128004	It is widely considered one of her worst films, and Hepburn received poor reviews for the effort.
128005	Hepburn kept a picture of Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life to "[keep] me humble."
128006	The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance sale.
128007	Harris's poor direction had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance.
128008	Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal.
128009	It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics.
128010	Dorothy Parker quipped, "Katharine Hepburn runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."
128011	Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales.
128012	Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money I can make out of you."
128013	Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.
129000	After the failure of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to repeat the success of Little Women.
129001	There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a commercial failure.
129002	The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money at the box office.
129003	After three forgettable movies, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder.
129004	Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role.
129005	The picture was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination.
129006	Berman allowed Hepburn to select her next feature.
129007	She chose George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired her for the first time with Cary Grant.
129008	Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of the film.
129009	Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public.
129010	For her next film she played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936). It met with a similarly poor reception.
129011	A Woman Rebels (1937) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character fights against convention.
129012	Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy.
129013	Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.
130000	Alongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from Hepburn's attitude.
130001	She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative.
130002	When asked if she had any children, she snapped back, "Yes I have five: two white and three colored."
130003	She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname "Katharine of Arrogance". The public were also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure.
130004	Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood, so returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre.
130005	It had a successful tour, but uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway.
130006	Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.
130007	Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal.
130008	He reportedly told Hepburn, "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years."
130009	For her next feature, Stage Door (1937) paired Hepburn with Ginger Rogers in a role that mirrored her own life-that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress.
130010	Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers, and the film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
130011	But it was not the box office hit RKO had hoped.
130012	Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity.
130013	She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938) alongside Cary Grant.
130014	Hepburn played the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett.
130015	Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office.
130016	With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.
131000	Bringing Up Baby was the last picture Hepburn did at RKO.
131001	After its release, the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors considered "Box Office Poison". The next film RKO offered her was Mother Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects.
131002	Hepburn turned it down, and instead opted to buy herself out of her contract for $75,000.
131003	Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent.
131004	She signed on for the film version of Holiday (1938) with Columbia Pictures, pairing her for the third time with Grant.
131005	The comedy was well received by critics, but it failed to draw much of an audience, and the next script offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000—less than she had received at the start of her film career.
131006	Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, "No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time."
131007	Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own comeback vehicle.
131008	She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story.
131009	It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability.
131010	Howard Hughes, Hepburn's beau at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage.
131011	The pair also contributed a quarter of the play's production costs.
131012	The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 29, 1939.
131013	It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.
132000	Several of the major film studios approached Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play.
132001	She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, on the condition that she be the star.
132002	As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, but the co-stars she wanted, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, were both unavailable.
132003	Louis B. Mayer promised her James Stewart and $150,000 "for anyone else you want or can get."
132004	Hepburn chose her friend and previous co-star, Cary Grant, to whom she ceded top billing.
132005	Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers ... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of people want to see me fall flat on my face."
132006	Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside.
132007	Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in "re-creating" her public image.
132008	The Philadelphia Story was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall.
132009	The review in Time declared, "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven."
132010	Herb Golden of Variety stated, "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture ... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable."
132011	Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.
133000	Hepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the romantic comedy Woman of the Year.
133001	The idea for the film was proposed to her by Garson Kanin in 1941.
133002	Hepburn passed the outline onto Joseph L. Mankiewicz at MGM, who expressed an interest in the picture.
133003	Kanin recalled how Hepburn contributed to the script: reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project.
133004	Hepburn presented the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000-half for her, half for the authors, Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner, Jr.
133005	Her terms accepted, Hepburn was also given the director and co-star of her choice, George Stevens and Spencer Tracy.
133006	Released in 1942, Woman of the Year was another success.
133007	Critics praised the chemistry between the stars and, says Higham, noted Hepburn's "increasing maturity and polish". The World-Telegram commended two "brilliant performances Hepburn", and received a fourth Academy Award nomination for her role as independent career-woman Tess Harding.
133008	During the course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.
133009	In 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind.
133010	Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks.
133011	MGM were eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement.
133012	It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy-Hepburn pairing.
134000	Since Woman of the Year Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia.
134001	Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s-notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950.
134002	Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself.
134003	She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed.
134004	Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast.
134005	She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway.
134006	Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy-Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter weekend 1945.
134007	Hepburn's next film was Undercurrent (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received.
134008	A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama set in the American Old West entitled The Sea of Grass.
134009	Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad.
134010	The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love.
134011	She trained intensively with a pianist for the role.
134012	By the time of its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist witch-hunt in Hollywood.
134013	Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love.
134014	Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy-Hepburn picture.
134015	Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box office.
135000	Tracy and Hepburn appeared on screen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film Adam's Rib.
135001	Like Woman of the Year, it was a "battle of the sexes" comedy, and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon.
135002	A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in court, Hepburn described it as "perfect for [Tracy] and me". She was instrumental in getting Judy Holliday cast in the film, which kick-started the young actress's Hollywood career.
135003	Although Hepburn's political views still prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country, Adam's Rib was a hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy–Hepburn picture to date.
135004	The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was full of praise for the film and hailed the duo's "perfect compatibility". The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most actresses began to retreat.
135005	Berg describes the decade as "the heart of her vast legacy" and "the period in which she truly came into her own."
135006	In January 1950, Hepburn made her first venture into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It.
135007	She hoped to prove she could play already established material, and said, "It's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time."
135008	It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows.
135009	The production then went on tour.
135010	Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material on the stage.
136000	In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, her first movie in Technicolor.
136001	She played Rose Sayer, a prim spinster missionary living in German East Africa at the outbreak of World War I.
136002	Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced.
136003	It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming.
136004	Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience.
136005	The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards.
136006	The first successful film she had made without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, it proved that she could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.
136007	Hepburn went on to make the sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second film written specifically as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon.
136008	Hepburn was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to me that her audience was missing a treat."
136009	Hepburn was asked to gain weight for the role, and she was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not end up in the film.
136010	Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy.
136011	The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
137000	In the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London's West End for a ten-week run of George Bernard Shaw's The Millionairess.
137001	Her parents had read Shaw to her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the actress.
137002	Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was "on the verge of a nervous breakdown". Widely acclaimed, The Millionairess was brought to Broadway.
137003	In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run.
137004	Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by Preston Sturges, and Hepburn offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself, but no studio picked up the project.
137005	She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career.
137006	Pat and Mike was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making her free to select her own projects.
137007	She spent two years resting and traveling, before committing to David Lean's romantic drama Summertime (1955). The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has a passionate love affair.
137008	She described it as "a very emotional part" and found it fascinating to work with Lean.
137009	At her own insistence, Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result. The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work.
137010	Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress.
137011	The following year, Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, playing Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Kate in The Taming of the Shrew, and Isabella in Measure for Measure.
137012	The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort.
138000	Hepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it seemed that Hepburn had found a niche in playing "love-starved spinsters" that critics, audiences, and her peers clearly enjoyed.
138001	Hepburn said of playing such roles, "With Lizzie Curry [The Rainmaker] and Jane Hudson [Summertime] and Rosie Sayer [The African Queen]—I was playing me. It wasn't difficult for me to play those women, because I'm the maiden aunt."
138002	Less success that year came from The Iron Petticoat (1956), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope.
138003	Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther called "horrible". It was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.
138004	Tracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's spinster persona, but it performed poorly at the box office.
138005	That summer Hepburn returned to Shakespeare.
138006	Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing.
138007	The shows were positively received.
138008	After two years away from the screen, she starred in a film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' controversial play Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.
138009	The movie was shot in London, and was "a completely miserable experience" for Hepburn.
138010	She clashed with director Joseph L. Mankiewicz during filming, which culminated with her spitting at him in disgust.
138011	The picture was a financial success, and her work as creepy aunt Violet Venable gave Hepburn her eighth Oscar nomination.
138012	Williams was pleased with the performance, writing, "Kate is a playwright's dream actress. She makes dialogue sound better than it is by a matchless beauty and clarity of diction". He wrote The Night of the Iguana (1961) with Hepburn in mind, but the actress, although flattered, felt the play was wrong for her and declined the part, which went to Bette Davis.
139000	Hepburn returned to Stratford in the summer of 1960 to play Viola in Twelfth Night and Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra.
139001	The New York Post wrote of her Cleopatra, "Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch."
139002	Hepburn herself was proud of the role.
139003	Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962). It was a low-budget production, and Hepburn appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary.
139004	She called it "the greatest [play] this country has ever produced" and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone "the most challenging female role in American drama", and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career.
139005	Long Day's Journey Into Night earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival.
139006	It remains one of her most praised performances.
139007	Following the completion of Long Day's Journey Into Night, Hepburn took a break in her career to care for the ailing Spencer Tracy.
139008	She did not work again until 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, her ninth film with Tracy.
139009	The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn's niece, Katharine Houghton, playing her daughter.
139010	Tracy was dying by this point, suffering the effects of heart disease, and Houghton later commented that her aunt was "extremely tense" during the production.
139011	Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene.
139012	Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to date.
139013	She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her first.
139014	Hepburn felt the award was not just for her, but was also given to honor Tracy.
140000	Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy's death, choosing to preoccupy herself as a remedy against grief.
140001	She received numerous scripts and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion In Winter (1968), a part she called "fascinating". She read extensively in preparation for the role, in which she starred opposite Peter O'Toole.
140002	Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France, an experience she loved despite being—according to director Anthony Harvey—"enormously vulnerable" throughout.
140003	John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was "the performance of her ... career", and proved that she was "a growing, developing, still surprising actress". The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress.
140004	The role, combined with her performance in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, also won Hepburn a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress.
140005	Hepburn's next appearance was in The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion in Winter.
140006	The picture was a failure critically and financially, and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance.
140007	From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical Coco, about the life of Coco Chanel.
140008	Hepburn admitted that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical.
140009	She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, "what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts". The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show.
140010	She was nervous about every performance, and recalled "wondering what the hell I was doing there."
140011	Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised and Coco was popular with the public.
140012	Hepburn would typically receive a standing ovation at the end of the night, and the show's run was twice extended.
140013	She later said Coco marked the first time she accepted that the public were not against her, but actually seemed to love her.
140014	Her work earned Hepburn a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.
141000	Hepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [alone]". First she traveled to Spain to film a version of Euripides' The Trojan Women (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave.
141001	When asked why she had taken the role, she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything while she still had time.
141002	The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress that year.
141003	In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels With My Aunt, but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself.
141004	The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith.
141005	Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.
141006	She then ventured into television for the first time, in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie.
141007	Hepburn had been wary of the medium but it proved to be one of the main television events of 1973, scoring high in the Nielsen ratings.
141008	Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work on the small screen.
141009	Her next project was the television movie Love Among the Ruins (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier.
141010	It received positive reviews and high ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.
142000	Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten.
142001	She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, "I'm very happy I didn't hear anyone call out 'It's about time'." The following year, she was paired with John Wayne in the Western Rooster Cogburn, a sequel to his Oscar-winning film True Grit.
142002	Echoing her African Queen character Rose Sayer, Hepburn again played a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member's death.
142003	The movie received mediocre reviews.
142004	Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful.
142005	In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of A Matter of Gravity.
142006	The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress, and the play was popular despite poor reviews.
142007	It later went on a successful nationwide tour.
142008	During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn fractured her hip.
142009	She chose to continue the tour performing in a wheelchair.
142010	That year, she was voted "Favorite Motion Picture Actress" by the People's Choice Awards.
142011	After three years away from the screen, Hepburn starred in the 1978 film Olly Olly Oxen Free.
142012	The adventure comedy was one of the biggest failures of her career-the screenwriter James Prideaux, who worked with Hepburn, later wrote that it "died at the moment of release" and referred to it as her "lost film". Hepburn claimed the main reason she had done the film was the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon.
142013	The television movie The Corn Is Green (1979), which was filmed in Wales, followed.
142014	It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor, and gained her a third Emmy nomination.
143000	By the 1980s Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor, giving her a permanently shaking head.
143001	She did not work for two years, saying in a television interview, "I've had my day-let the kids scramble and sweat it out."
143002	During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden Pond, and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age.
143003	Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer.
143004	On Golden Pond was a success, the second-highest grossing film of 1981.
143005	It demonstrated how energetic the 74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance.
143006	The movie won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award.
143007	Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win, "a tribute to her enduring career."
143008	Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1981.
143009	She received a second Tony nomination for her portrayal in The West Side Waltz of a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life.
143010	Variety observed that the role was "an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [Hepburn's] own public image."
143011	Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote of Hepburn and her performance, "One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines."
143012	She hoped to make a film out of the production, but nobody purchased the rights.
143013	Hepburn's reputation as one of America's best loved actors was firmly established by this point, as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by People magazine and again won the popularity award from People's Choice.
144000	In 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark comedy Grace Quigley, the story of an elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her.
144001	Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and the box office was poor.
144002	In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy.
144003	The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences.
144004	With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles.
144005	She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed Hepburn to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.
144006	In 1991 she released her autobiography, Me: Stories of my Life.
144007	It topped best-seller lists for over a year.
144008	She returned to television screens in 1992 for The Man Upstairs, co-starring Ryan O'Neal, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination.
144009	In 1994 she worked opposite Anthony Quinn in This Can't Be Love, which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with numerous references to her personality and career.
144010	These later roles have been described as "a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character" and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself.
145000	Hepburn's final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair (1994). At 86 years old, she played a supporting role alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty.
145001	It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo appearance in Stage Door Canteen she, in which did not play a leading role.
145002	Roger Ebert noted that it was the first time Hepburn had looked frail, but that the "magnificent spirit" was still there and said her scenes "steal the show". The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance, stating that "if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been". Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.
145003	Hepburn was known for being fiercely private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career.
145004	She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention in an era of glamour.
145005	She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking.
145006	Despite this she enjoyed the fame, and confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely.
145007	The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.
146000	Hepburn's relentless energy and enthusiasm for life is often cited in biographies, while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status.
146001	This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress, and she was famously blunt and outspoken.
146002	Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy". Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, "a me me me person". She saw herself as having a happy nature, reasoning "I like life and I've been so lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?"
146003	A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years, and said that while she was demanding, there remained a sense of humility and humanity.
146004	She led an active private life, reportedly swimming every morning and playing tennis.
146005	In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me.
146006	She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life.
146007	A small bust she sculpted of Spencer Tracy's head was featured in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.
146008	When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person."
146009	The anti-communist hysteria in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, and she made a speech against censorship in May 1947 that shocked the public.
146010	Targeted by right-wing activists as a supposed communist sympathizer, she was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
146011	She insisted that the claims made about her were untrue.
146012	For decades, Hepburn openly promoted birth control and supported abortion.
146013	She found great spirituality in existence, practicing Albert Schweitzer's theory of "Reverence for Life", but did not believe in religion or the afterlife.
146014	In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people."
146015	Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.
147000	Hepburn's only husband was Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr.
147001	The couple married on December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29.
147002	Hepburn made Smith change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow so that she would not be known as "Kate Smith", which she considered too plain.
147003	She never fully committed to the relationship and prioritized her career.
147004	The move to Hollywood the couple's in 1932 cemented estrangement, and in 1934, she traveled to Mexico to get a quick divorce.
147005	Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial support and moral in the early days of her career, and in her autobiography called herself "a terrible pig" for exploiting his love.
147006	The pair remained friends until his death in 1979.
147007	Soon after moving to California, Hepburn began a relationship with her agent Leland Hayward.
147008	Both were married.
147009	Hayward proposed to Hepburn after they had each divorced, but she did not wish to be married again.
147010	She "liked the idea of being my own single self."
147011	They were involved for four years.
147012	In 1936, while she was touring Jane Eyre, Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes.
147013	They first met while Hepburn was filming Sylvia Scarlett, when they were introduced by their mutual friend Cary Grant.
147014	Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but at that time Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting her failing career.
147015	They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled "box office poison".
148000	Hepburn stuck to her decision not to remarry, and made a conscious choice not to have children.
148001	She felt that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, and it was not one she was willing to make. "
148002	I would have been a terrible mother," she told Berg, "because I'm basically a very selfish human being."
148003	She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.
148004	Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual.
148005	In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case.
148006	In response to this speculation about her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian."
148007	The most significant relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy.
148008	In her autobiography she wrote, "It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I would have done anything for him."
148009	Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how "blindingly" in love Hepburn was with the actor.
148010	The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs.
148011	Meeting Tracy Hepburn when she was 34 and he was 41, was initially wary of, unimpressed that she had dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she "knew right away that I found him irresistible."
148012	Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce.
148013	Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.
148014	With Tracy determined to conceal the relationship with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private.
148015	They were careful not to be seen in public together, and maintained separate residences.
148016	Tracy was a periodic alcoholic and troubled individual, whom Hepburn described as "tortured" by guilt and misery, and she devoted herself to making his life easier.
148017	Reports from people who saw them together describe how Hepburn's entire demeanor changed when around Tracy.
148018	She mothered and obeyed him, and Tracy became heavily dependent on her.
148019	They often spent stretches of time apart due to their work, particularly in the 1950s when Hepburn was largely abroad for career commitments.
149000	Tracy's health declined significantly in the 1960s, and Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him.
149001	She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967.
149002	Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral.
149003	It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star.
149004	In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, "I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could never have left him."
149005	She claimed not to know how Tracy felt about her and that they "just passed twenty-seven years [sic] together in what was to me absolute bliss."
149006	Hepburn stated in her eighties, "I have no fear of death. Must be wonderful, like a long sleep."
149007	Her health began to deteriorate not long after her final screen appearance.
149008	In the winter of 1996 she was hospitalized with pneumonia.
149009	By 1997 she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die.
149010	She showed signs of dementia in her final years.
149011	In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's neck.
149012	The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died on June 29, 2003, at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut.
149013	She was 96 years old and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford.
149014	Hepburn requested that there be no memorial service.
150000	Hepburn's death received considerable public attention.
150001	Many tributes were held on television, and newspapers and magazines dedicated issues to the actress.
150002	American president George W. Bush said Hepburn "will be remembered as one of the nation's artistic treasures."
150003	In honor of her extensive theatre work, the lights of Broadway were dimmed for the evening of July 1, 2003.
150004	In 2004, in accordance with Hepburn's wishes, her belongings were put up for auction with Sotheby's in New York.
150005	The event garnered $5.8 million, which Hepburn willed to her family.
180000	Margaret Ruth "Maggie" Gyllenhaal (born November 16, 1977) is an American actress.
180001	She is the daughter of director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner (née Achs) and the older sister of actor Jake Gyllenhaal.
180002	She made her screen debut when she began to appear in her father's films.
180003	Gyllenhaal achieved recognition in a supporting role in the independent cult film, Donnie Darko (2001). Her breakthrough role was in the sadomasochistic romance, Secretary (2002), for which she received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination.
180004	Gyllenhaal has appeared in an eclectic range of films including Sherrybaby (2006) for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe; the romantic comedy, Trust The Man (2006); and numerous big-budget films such as World Trade Center (2006) and The Dark Knight (2008). She next starred in the musical-drama, Crazy Heart (2009), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
180005	Gyllenhaal has also appeared in such theatrical plays as Closer (2000) as well as in television productions like Strip Search (2004). Gyllenhaal has been in a relationship with actor Peter Sarsgaard since 2002.
180006	In 2006, the two became engaged, and Gyllenhaal gave birth to their daughter, Ramona, on October 3, 2006.
180007	On May 2, 2009, she married Sarsgaard in Italy.
180008	The second daughter, Gloria Ray, was born April 19, 2012.
180009	Gyllenhaal is a politically active Democrat and, like her brother and parents, supports the American Civil Liberties Union.
180010	Prior to the US-led invasion of Iraq she participated in anti-war demonstrations.
180011	Gyllenhaal drew criticism in 2005 for her opinion that America was "responsible in some way" for the September 11 attacks.
180012	She is actively involved in human rights, civil liberty, anti-poverty and parent trigger causes.
181000	Gyllenhaal was born in New York City to film director Stephen Gyllenhaal and film producer and screenwriter Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal (née Achs). Jake Gyllenhaal, her younger brother, is also an actor.
181001	Her father, who was raised in the Swedenborgian religion, is of Swedish and English ancestry, and is a member of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family.
181002	Her last purely Swedish ancestor was her great-grandfather, a descendant of Leonard Gyllenhaal, a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg's writings.
181003	Born in New York City, her mother is Jewish with both Russian and Lithuanian ancestry and is divorced from Eric Foner, a noted historian and history professor at Columbia University.
181004	Gyllenhaal has stated that she "grew up mostly Jewish, culturally", though she did not attend Hebrew school.
181005	Married in 1977, her parents filed for divorce in October 2008.
181006	Gyllenhaal grew up in Los Angeles, California, and studied at the Harvard-Westlake prep school.
181007	In 1995, she graduated from Harvard-Westlake and moved to New York to attend Columbia University, where she studied literature and Eastern religions; she graduated in 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.
181008	After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, she took a summer job working as a waitress in a Massachusetts restaurant.
182000	Ruth Elizabeth "Bette" Davis (April 5, 1908 - October 6, 1989) was an American actress of film, television and theater.
182001	Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters, she was highly regarded for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies, although her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas.
182002	After appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early films for Universal Studios (and as loanout to other studios) were unsuccessful.
182003	She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances.
182004	In 1937, she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career.
182005	Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style.
182006	Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio executives, film directors and costars were often reported.
182007	Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and satirized.
183000	Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
183001	She won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, was the first person to accrue 10 Academy Award nominations for acting, and was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.
183002	Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships.
183003	Married four times, she was once widowed and thrice divorced, and raised her children as a single parent.
183004	Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer, with more than 100 films, television and theater roles to her credit.
183005	In 1999, Davis was placed second, after Katharine Hepburn, on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of all time.
183006	Ruth Elizabeth Davis, known from early childhood as "Betty", was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Ruth Augusta "Ruthie" (née Favor) and Harlow Morrell Davis, a patent attorney; her sister, Barbara "Bobby", was born October 25, 1909.
183007	The family was Protestant, of English, French, and Welsh ancestry.
183008	In 1915, Davis's parents separated and Betty and Bobby attended a Spartan boarding school called Crestalban in Lanesborough, which is located in the Berkshires.
183009	In 1921, Ruth Davis moved to New York City with her daughters, where she worked as a portrait photographer.
183010	Betty was inspired to become an actress after seeing Rudolph Valentino in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) and Mary Pickford in Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), and changed the spelling of her name to "Bette" after Honoré de Balzac's La Cousine Bette.
183011	She received encouragement from her mother, who had aspired to become an actress.
184000	She attended Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, where she met her future husband, Harmon O. Nelson, known as "Ham". In 1926, she saw a production of Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck with Blanche Yurka and Peg Entwistle.
184001	Davis later recalled that it inspired her full commitment to her chosen career, and said, "Before that performance I wanted to be an actress. When it ended, I had to be an actress... exactly like Peg Entwistle."
184002	She auditioned for admission to Eva LeGallienne's Manhattan Civic Repertory, but was rejected by LeGallienne who described her attitude as "insincere" and "frivolous". She was accepted by the John Murray Anderson School of Theatre, and studied dance with Martha Graham.
184003	She auditioned for George Cukor's stock theater company, and although he was not very impressed, he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment anyway - a one-week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play Broadway.
184004	She was later chosen to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play, in The Wild Duck.
184005	After performing in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston, she made her Broadway debut in 1929 in Broken Dishes, and followed it with Solid South.
184006	A Universal Studios talent scout saw her perform and invited her to Hollywood for a screen test.
185000	Aaron Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an Academy and Emmy-award winning American screenwriter, producer, and playwright, whose works include A Few Good Men, The American President, The West Wing, Sports Night, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Charlie Wilson's War, The Social Network, Moneyball and The Newsroom.
185001	After graduating from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre in 1983, Sorkin spent much of the 1980s in New York as a struggling, sporadically employed actor.
185002	He found his passion in writing plays, and quickly established himself as a promising young playwright.
185003	His stage play A Few Good Men caught the attention of Hollywood producer David Brown, who bought the film rights before the play even premiered.
185004	Castle Rock Entertainment hired Sorkin to adapt A Few Good Men for the big screen.
185005	The film, directed by Rob Reiner, became a box office success.
185006	Sorkin spent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock, Malice and The American President.
185007	In the mid-1990s he worked as a script doctor on films such as Bulworth.
185008	In 1998 his television career began when he created the comedy series Sports Night for the ABC network.
185009	The second season of Sports Night was its last and in 1999 overlapped with the debut of Sorkin's next TV series, the political drama The West Wing, this time for the NBC network.
185010	The West Wing won multiple Emmy Awards, and continued for three more seasons after he left the show at the end of its fourth season in 2003.
185011	He returned to television in 2006 with the dramedy Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, about the backstage drama at a late-night sketch comedy show, once again for the NBC network.
185012	While Sorkin's return was met with high expectations and a lot of early online buzz before Studio 60's premiere, NBC did not renew it after its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception in the press and on the Internet.
185013	He also wrote the feature film screenplay for The Social Network, winning the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
186000	After more than a decade away from the theatre, Sorkin returned to adapt for the stage his screenplay The Farnsworth Invention, which started a workshop run at La Jolla Playhouse in February 2007 and which opened on Broadway in December 2007.
186001	He was a cocaine addict for many years, but after a highly publicized arrest in 2001 he received treatment in a drug diversion program and is reported to have recovered.
186002	In television, Sorkin is known as a controlling writer, who rarely shares the credit of penning screenplays.
186003	His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with stories for him to tell.
186004	His trademark rapid-fire dialogue and extended monologues are complemented, in television, by frequent collaborator Thomas Schlamme's characteristic directing technique called the "walk and talk". These sequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.
186005	Sorkin was born in Manhattan and raised in the wealthy suburb of Scarsdale, New York.
186006	His mother was a school teacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and put himself through college on the G.I. Bill; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers.
186007	His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting.
186008	Before he reached his teenage years, his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and That Championship Season.
187000	Sorkin attended Scarsdale High School where he became involved in his high school drama and theatre club.
187001	In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical Li'l Abner.
187002	In the Scarsdale High School senior class production of Once Upon a Mattress, Sorkin played Sir Harry.
187003	In 1979, Sorkin attended Syracuse University.
187004	In his freshman year he failed a class that was a core requirement.
187005	It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the Drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes.
187006	He returned in his sophomore year determined to do better, and graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of fine arts degree in musical theatre.
187007	After graduation, Sorkin moved to New York City where he worked odd jobs including delivering singing telegrams, driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children's theatre company Traveling Playhouse, handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show, and bartending on Broadway at theatres such as the Palace Theatre.
187008	One weekend, while house sitting at a friend's place he found an IBM Selectric typewriter, started typing, and "felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life."
188000	He continued writing and eventually put together his first play Removing All Doubt which he sent to his old theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed.
188001	In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University.
188002	After that, he wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988.
188003	The contents of his first two plays got him a theatrical agent.
188004	Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden in This Picture and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.
188005	His reputation as a playwright was quickly gaining stature on the New York theatre scene.
189000	Sorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a 3-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps.
189001	She was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer.
189002	Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.
189003	He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512k so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.
189004	In 1988 Sorkin sold the film rights for his play A Few Good Men to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal reportedly "well into six figures."
189005	Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin's one-act play Hidden in This Picture and found out Sorkin also had a play called A Few Good Men that was having Off Broadway readings.
189006	Brown produced A Few Good Men on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre.
189007	It starred Tom Hulce and was directed by Don Scardino.
189008	After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.
189009	Sorkin continued writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan and directed by Don Scardino.
189010	Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures and tried to interest them in making A Few Good Men into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement.
189011	Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film.
189012	Rob Reiner, a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.
190000	In the early 1990s, Sorkin worked under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc.
190001	He wrote the scripts for A Few Good Men, Malice, and The American President: the three films grossed about $400 million worldwide.
190002	While writing for Castle Rock he became friends with colleagues such as William Goldman and Rob Reiner and met his future wife, Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock's business-affairs lawyers.
190003	Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for A Few Good Men in his New York apartment, learning the craft of screenwriting from a book about screenplay format.
190004	He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with Rob Reiner.
190005	William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay.
190006	The movie was directed by Rob Reiner, starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by David Brown.
190007	A Few Good Men was released in 1992 and was a box office success.
191000	Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for Malice.
191001	Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts of Malice.
191002	Sorkin had to leave the project to finish up the script for A Few Good Men, and screenwriter Scott Frank wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay.
191003	When production on A Few Good Men wrapped up, Sorkin took over and continued working on the script for Malice through until the final shooting script.
191004	Harold Becker directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin.
191005	Malice had mixed reviews.
191006	Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish". Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having "suspense but no staying power". Sorkin's last produced screenplay for Castle Rock was The American President and once again he worked with William Goldman, who served as a creative consultant.
191007	It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay for The American President, which started off as a massive 385-page screenplay; it was eventually whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages.
191008	Rob Reiner directed.
191009	The film was critically acclaimed.
191010	Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times described the film as "genial and entertaining if not notably inspired", and believed its most interesting aspects were the "pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed". Sorkin did uncredited script doctor work on several films in the 1990s.
191011	He wrote some quips for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in The Rock.
191012	He worked on Excess Baggage, a comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention, and rewrote some of Will Smith's scenes in Enemy of the State.
191013	Sorkin collaborated with Warren Beatty on a couple of scripts, one of which was Bulworth.
191014	Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms which never went into production.
191015	At one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script; however, he eventually continued working on the script once the matter was settled.
192000	Sorkin came up with the idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the screenplay for The American President.
192001	He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter.
192002	The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series.
192003	Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.
192004	Sorkin fought with the ABC network during the first season over the use of a laugh track and a live studio audience.
192005	The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com describing it as "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you have no choice but to use the laugh track. Oftentimes [enhancing the laughs] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me."
192006	The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season.
192007	Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.
192008	Although Sports Night was critically acclaimed, ABC canceled the show after two seasons due to its low ratings.
192009	Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly contingent on his involvement which would have been a difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing The West Wing at that point.
193000	Sorkin conceived the political TV drama The West Wing in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a show centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President.
193001	He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and the passion of the people who serve.
193002	Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience would not be able to take a show about the White House seriously.
193003	When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance.
193004	The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. TV.
193005	The West Wing was honored with nine Emmy Awards for its debut season, making the show a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season.
193006	Following the awards ceremony, a fiasco ensued, centered on the Emmy for writing The West Wing episode "In Excelsis Deo" which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland, when it was reported in a The New York Times article that Cleveland had been ushered off the stage by Sorkin without being given a chance to say a few words.
193007	The story behind The West Wing episode is based on Cleveland's father, a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street, as Cleveland explains in his FreshYarn.com essay titled "I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses". A back and forth took place between Sorkin and Cleveland in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV where Sorkin explained that he gives his writers "Story By" credit on a rotating basis "by way of a gratuity" and that he had thrown out Cleveland's script and started from scratch.
193008	In the end, Sorkin apologized to Cleveland.
193009	Cleveland and Sorkin also won the Writers Guild of America Award for best episodic drama at the February 2001 ceremony for "In Excelsis Deo".
194000	In 2001, after wrapping up the second season of The West Wing, Sorkin had a drug relapse, only two months after receiving a Phoenix Rising Award for drug recovery; this became public knowledge when he was arrested at Burbank Airport for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine.
194001	He was ordered by a judge to attend a drug diversion program.
194002	His drug addiction was highly publicized, most notably when Saturday Night Live did a parody called "The West Wing", though he did recover.
194003	In 2002, Sorkin criticized NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw's TV special about a day in the life of a president, "The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing", comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting.
194004	Sorkin's TV series The West Wing aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC's Entertainment President Jeff Zucker he apologized, but would later say "there should be a difference between what NBC News does and what The West Wing TV series does."
195000	Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays in all, which amounts to nearly every episode during the show's first four Emmy-winning seasons.
195001	Sorkin describes his role in the creative process as "not so much [that of] a showrunner or a producer. I'm really a writer."
195002	He admits that this approach can have its drawbacks, saying "Out of 88 [West Wing] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never, not once."
195003	In 2003, at the end of the fourth season, Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. TV not involving the NBC network, thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner.
195004	Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenture apart from 60 seconds of the first season five episode, describing the experience as "like watching somebody make out with my girlfriend."
195005	Sorkin would later return in the final episode in a cameo appearance as a member of President Bartlet's staff.
195006	In 2003 Sorkin divulged to the American television interviewer Charlie Rose on The Charlie Rose Show that he was developing a TV series based on a late-night sketch comedy show like Saturday Night Live.
195007	In early October 2005 a pilot script dubbed Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip for a new TV series, written by him and with Tommy Schlamme attached as producer, started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web.
195008	A week later, NBC bought from Warner Bros. TV the right to show the TV series on their network for a near-record license fee in a bidding war with CBS.
195009	The show's name was later changed to Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.
195010	Sorkin described the show as having "autobiographical elements" to it and "characters that are based on actual people" but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night sketch comedy show.
196000	In September 2006, the pilot for Studio 60 aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme.
196001	The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12 million people, but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season.
196002	The seething anticipation that preceded the début was followed up by a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the blogosphere.
196003	In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources.
196004	After two months on hiatus, Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.
197000	In 2003, Sorkin was writing a screenplay on spec about the story of inventor and television pioneer Philo Farnsworth, a topic he had first become familiar with back in the early 1990s when producer Fred Zollo approached him with the idea of adapting a memoir by Elma Farnsworth into a biopic.
197001	The next year he completed the screenplay under the title "The Farnsworth Invention", and it was picked up by New Line Cinema with Thomas Schlamme signed on to direct.
197002	The story is about the patent battle between inventor Philo Farnsworth and RCA tycoon David Sarnoff for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions in the US.
197003	At the same time, Sorkin was contacted by Jocelyn Clarke, the commissions manager of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, requesting he write a play for them, a commission which he accepted.
197004	In time Sorkin decided to tackle his commission by rewriting "The Farnsworth Invention" as a play.
197005	He delivered a first draft of the play to the Abbey Theatre in early 2005, and a production was purportedly planned for 2007 with La Jolla Playhouse in California deciding to stage a workshop production of the play in collaboration with the Abbey Theatre.
197006	But in 2006 the Abbey Theatre's new management pulled out of all involvement with The Farnsworth Invention.
197007	Despite the setback, La Jolla Playhouse pushed on, with Steven Spielberg lending his talents as producer.
197008	The production opened under La Jolla's signature Page To Stage program which allowed Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show to show according to audience reactions and feedback; the play ran at La Jolla Playhouse from February 20, 2007 through March 25, 2007.
197009	A production followed on Broadway, beginning in previews at the Music Box Theatre and scheduled to open on November 14, 2007; however, the play was delayed by the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike.
197010	The Farnsworth Invention eventually opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3, 2007 following the end of the strike; it closed on March 2, 2008.
197011	In 2005, Sorkin revised his play A Few Good Men for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket.
197012	The play opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the fall of the same year and was directed by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role.
198000	Sorkin's next jaunt back into film occurred when he was commissioned by Universal Pictures to adapt 60 Minutes producer George Crile's nonfiction book Charlie Wilson's War for Tom Hanks' production company Playtone.
198001	Charlie Wilson's War is about the colorful Texas congressman Charlie Wilson who funded the CIA's secret war against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
198002	Sorkin completed the screenplay and the film was released in 2007 starring Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols.
198003	In August 2008, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script for Sony and producer Scott Rudin about how Facebook was founded.
198004	The film, The Social Network, based on Ben Mezrich's novel The Accidental Billionaires, was released on October 1, 2010.
198005	Sorkin won the Academy, BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for The Social Network.
198006	One year later, Sorkin received nominations for the same awards for co-writing the screenplay to the film Moneyball.
199000	Sorkin returned to television in 2011 with two HBO projects.
199001	He is teaming with The Office star John Krasinski to develop a miniseries about the Chateau Marmont Hotel based on Life at the Marmont, a book by the hotel's co-owner Raymond R. Sarlot and Fred Basten.
199002	He is also developing The Newsroom, a series about the behind the scenes workings of a cable news network.
199003	On September 8, 2011, HBO ordered ten episodes of The Newsroom, which debuted on June 24, 2012.
199004	The Newsroom has been renewed for a second season, which will premiere in June 2013.
20000	William Bradley "Brad" Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and is the son of Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a high school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company owner.
200000	In March 2007, it was reported that Sorkin had signed on to write a musical adaptation of the hit 2002 record Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots by psychedelic-rock band The Flaming Lips, collaborating with director Des McAnuff who has been developing the project.
200001	On July 12, 2007, Variety reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with DreamWorks to write three scripts.
200002	The first script is titled The Trial of the Chicago 7, which Sorkin was already developing with Steven Spielberg and producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald.
200003	In March 2010, Sorkin's agent, Ari Emanuel, was reported as saying that the project was proving "tough to get together". In August 2008, Des McAnuff announced that Sorkin had been commissioned by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival to write an adaptation of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard.
200004	In 2010, Sorkin reportedly obtained the film rights to Andrew Young's book, The Politician (about Sen. John Edwards), and announced that he would make his debut as a film director while also adapting the book for the screen.
200005	In November 2010, it was reported that he is writing a musical based on the life of Houdini, with music by Danny Elfman.
200006	In January 2012, it is reported that Stephen Schwartz is now writing the music and lyrics, while Sorkin is making his debut as a librettist.
200007	The musical is expected to come out in 2013-14, with Sorkin saying "The chance to collaborate with Stephen Schwartz, (the director) Jack O'Brien, and Hugh Jackman on a new Broadway musical is a huge gift."
200008	In May 2012, it was announced that Sorkin would be writing an upcoming movie based on the life of Steve Jobs.
20001	The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Doug (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969). Born into a conservative household, he was raised as Southern Baptist, although he has since described himself as oscillating between atheism and agnosticism.
20002	Pitt has stated that his family's ancestry consists of "probably ... Irish-Scots-Germans who settled in the area ... I know we have some Seminole, and some Cherokee Indian, in us". Pitt has described Springfield as "Mark Twain country, Jesse James country", having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot of lakes". Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, tennis, wrestling and swimming teams.
20003	He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.
20004	Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism, with a focus on advertising.
20005	As a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity He, he acted in several fraternity shows.
20006	As graduation approached, did not feel ready to settle down.
20007	loved films - "a portal into different worlds for me" - and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.
20008	Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.
201000	Sorkin has written for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied.
201001	He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme for nearly a decade on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media.
201002	He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts.
201003	He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.
201004	A The New York Times article by Peter De Jonge explained that "The West Wing is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time."
201005	Sorkin has also said, "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to."
201006	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script.
201007	Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, "I'm helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren't written by committee."
202000	Sorkin's nearly decade-long collaboration in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night.
202001	Their successful partnership in television is one in which Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.
202002	Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing.
202003	Sorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue, such as the "You can't handle the truth!" piece from A Few Good Men and the partly Latin tirade against God in The West Wing episode "Two Cathedrals". For television, one hallmark of Sorkin's writer's voice is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation.
202004	Although his scripts are lauded for being literate, Sorkin has been criticized for often turning in scripts that are overwrought.
202005	His mentor William Goldman has commented that normally in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking this rule.
203000	He was married to Julia Bingham.
203001	They divorced, reportedly due at least in part to his workaholic habits and drug abuse.
203002	Sorkin and Bingham have one daughter, Roxy.
203003	For several years, he dated Kristin Chenoweth, who played Annabeth Schott on The West Wing (though after Sorkin had left the show). He has also reportedly dated columnist Maureen Dowd and is now in a relationship with Kristin Davis.
203004	A consistent supporter of the Democratic Party, Sorkin has made substantial political campaign contributions to candidates between 1999 and 2011, according to CampaignMoney.com.
203005	During the 2004 US presidential election campaign, the liberal advocacy group MoveOn's political action committee enlisted Sorkin and Rob Reiner to create one of their anti-Bush campaign advertisements.
203006	In August 2008, Sorkin was involved in a Generation Obama event at the Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California, participating in a panel discussion subsequent to a screening of Frank Capra's Mr Smith Goes to Washington.
203007	Despite this Sorkin does not consider himself a political activist noting " I've met political activists, and they're for real. I've never marched anyplace or done anything that takes more effort than writing a check in terms of activism"
204000	In 1987, Sorkin started using marijuana and cocaine.
204001	He has said that in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis.
204002	In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, on the advice of his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine.
204003	In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse.
204004	However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector.
204005	He was ordered to a drug diversion program.
204006	Saturday Night Live parodied the highly publicized event in a comedy sketch called "The West Wing" where the U.S. President played by Darrell Hammond does a "Walk and Talk" through the corridors of the White House while tripping on mushrooms, accompanied by host Pierce Brosnan.
204007	Sorkin continued working on The West Wing amidst his drug abuse.

205009	Hoffman was born in Los Angeles, the second son of Lillian (née Gold) and Harry Hoffman.
205010	His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.
205011	Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum.
205012	His older brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist.
205013	Hoffman is Jewish, from an Ashkenazi family of immigrants from Kiev and Iaşi (Romania). His upbringing was neither religious nor observant.
205014	He graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine.
205015	Hoffman left after a year to join the Pasadena Playhouse, although when he told his family about his career goal, an aunt warned him "You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough."
206000	Hoffman began his acting career at the Pasadena Playhouse, alongside future Academy Award-winner Gene Hackman.
206001	After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following.
206002	During this time period, he got an occasional bit television role, but left acting briefly to teach in order to support himself.
206003	Hoffman also occasionally performed television commercials; an oft-replayed segment on programs that explore actors' early work is a clip showing Hoffman touting the Volkswagen Fastback.
206004	In 1960, Hoffman was cast in a role in an Off-Broadway production and followed with a walk-on role in a Broadway production in 1961.
206005	Hoffman then studied at Actors Studio and became a dedicated method actor.
206006	Sidney W. Pink, a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered him in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in Madigan's Millions.
206007	His first critical success was in Eh? by Henry Livings, which had its US premiere at the Circle in the Square Downtown on October 16, 1966.
206008	Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including Naked City, The Defenders and Hallmark Hall of Fame.
206009	Hoffman made his theatrical film debut in The Tiger Makes Out in 1967, alongside Eli Wallach.
206010	In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on The Tiger Makes Out, Hoffman flew from New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, where he directed a production of William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life for the Emma Herbst Community Theatre.
206011	The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.
206012	In 1967, director Mike Nichols cast Hoffman in The Graduate, his first major role, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.
206013	Hoffman played the character of Benjamin Braddock, who returns to his wealthy parents' home in California after graduating college.
206014	Confused about what to do with his life, he is seduced into having an affair with Mrs. Robinson, an alcoholic and a neurotic, and the wife of his father's business partner.
207000	Although Life magazine joked that "[i]f Dustin Hoffman's face were his fortune, he'd be committed to a life of poverty", The Graduate was a gigantic box-office hit for Embassy Pictures, making Hoffman a major new star at the same time.
207001	The film, mostly due to Hoffman's acting, received near unanimously good reviews.
207002	Time magazine called Hoffman "a symbol of youth" who represented "a new breed of actors."
207003	According to Hoffman biographer and film historian Jeff Lenburg, "newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans," including one published in the New York Times : I identified with Ben... I thought of him as a spiritual brother.
207004	He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am.
207005	It's a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually.":
207006	35 Turner Classic Movies critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented "a new generation of actors."
207007	He credits Hoffman with breaking "the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters."
207008	Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman's career : In The Graduate, he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.
207009	In December 1968, Hoffman returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of Murray Schisgal and John Sebastian's musical Jimmy Shine.
207010	For his performance in the production, Hoffman won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.
207011	Just a few weeks after leaving the production, Hoffman's next major film, Midnight Cowboy, premiered in theatres across the United States on May 25, 1969.
207012	For his role as Ratso Rizzo in the film, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won the Best Picture honor.
207013	This was followed by his role in Little Big Man (1970) where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man.
207014	The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for Chief Dan George.
208000	Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years.
208001	Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (1971), Straw Dogs (also 1971), and Papillon (1973) were followed by Lenny (1974), for which Hoffman received his third nomination for Best Actor in seven years.
208002	Less than two years after the Watergate scandal, Hoffman and Robert Redford starred as Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively, in All the President's Men (1976). Hoffman next starred in Marathon Man (also 1976), a film based on William Goldman's novel of the same name, opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider.
208003	Hoffman's next roles were less successful.
208004	He opted out of directing Straight Time (1978), but starred as a thief.
208005	His next film, Michael Apted's Agatha, was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie.
208006	Hoffman next starred in Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) as workaholic Ted Kramer whose wife (Meryl Streep) unexpectedly leaves him; he raises their son alone.
208007	Hoffman gained his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep) and Director.
208008	In Tootsie (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera.
208009	His co-star was Jessica Lange.
208010	Tootsie earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman's fifth nomination.
208011	In 1984, Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of the 1949 Arthur Miller play, Death of a Salesman, a role he reprised in a TV movie of the same name, for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Lead Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries.
208012	He also went on to win a Golden Globe for the same performance.
208013	Hoffman's largest film failure was Elaine May's Ishtar, with Warren Beatty.
208014	The film faced severe production problems, received almost completely negative reviews from critics and was nominated for three Razzie awards.
208015	However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film's final cut and tried to defend it.
208016	Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and Ishtar became a cult film.
208017	James House, who later became a country music artist, served as Hoffman's vocal coach in the film.
209000	In director Barry Levinson's Rain Man (1988), Hoffman starred as an autistic savant, opposite Tom Cruise.
209001	Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman's performance gained him his second Academy Award.
209002	Upon accepting, Hoffman stated softly to his fellow nominees that it was okay if they didn't vote for him because "I didn't vote for you guys either."
209003	After Rain Man, Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in Family Business.
209004	The film did relatively poorly with the critics and at the box office.
209005	In 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in The Simpsons episode "Lisa's Substitute", under the pseudonym Sam Etic.
209006	As a reference to this episode, during the episode featuring the Itchy & Scratchy movie, Lisa claims that Dustin Hoffman had a cameo in that movie but didn't use his real name.
209007	Throughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as Dick Tracy (1990) (where his Ishtar co-star Beatty plays the titular character), Hero (1992) and Billy Bathgate (1991) co-starring with Nicole Kidman who was nominated for a Golden Globe). Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's Hook (also 1991), earning a Golden Globe nomination; in this movie, Hoffman's costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it.
209008	Hoffman played the lead role in Outbreak (1995), alongside Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland.
209009	Following that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge-drama / legal-thriller Sleepers (1996) with Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, and Kevin Bacon.

209014	Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder's Runaway Jury (also 2003), an adaptation of John Grisham's bestselling novel.
210000	Hoffman played theater owner Charles Frohman in the J. M. Barrie historical fantasia Finding Neverland (2004), costarring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.
210001	In director David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite Lily Tomlin as an existential detective team member.
210002	Seven years after his nomination for Wag the Dog, Hoffman got a second opportunity to perform again with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Barbra Streisand and Ben Stiller in the 2004 comedy Meet the Fockers, a sequel to Meet the Parents (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.
210003	In 2005, he voiced a horse in Racing Stripes, and appeared in cameo roles in Andy García's The Lost City and on the final episode of HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm's fifth season.
210004	Hoffman appeared in Stranger than Fiction (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in Tom Tykwer's film Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (also 2006), and had a cameo in the same year's The Holiday.

210006	In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated film, Hoffman had a prominent role as Shifu in the acclaimed film Kung Fu Panda, which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with Jack Black (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character's poignantly complex relationship with the story's villain.
210007	He later won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for Kung Fu Panda and has continued into the role in the franchise's subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise's television series.
210008	He next voiced Roscuro in The Tale of Despereaux and played the title character in Last Chance Harvey.
211000	He appeared in Little Fockers, the critically panned yet hugely commercially successful 2010 sequel to Meet the Fockers.

213000	Kirsten Caroline Dunst (born April 30, 1982) is an American-German  actress, singer and model.
213001	She made her film debut in Oedipus Wrecks, a short film directed by Woody Allen for the anthology New York Stories (1989). At the age of 12, Dunst gained widespread recognition playing the role of vampire Claudia in Interview with the Vampire (1994), a performance for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.
213002	She appeared in Little Women the same year and in Jumanji the following year to further acclaim.
213003	After supporting roles in the television series ER (1996) and films such as Wag the Dog (1997), Small Soldiers (1998) and The Virgin Suicides (1999), Dunst transitioned into romantic comedies and comedy dramas, starring in Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), Bring It On (2000), Get Over It and Crazy / Beautiful (both 2001). Dunst achieved international fame as a result of her portrayal of Mary Jane Watson in the Spider-Man trilogy (2002 - 07). Since then her films have included the romantic comedy Wimbledon (2004), the romantic science fiction Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Cameron Crowe's tragicomedy Elizabethtown (2005).

213004	She also sang the jazz song "After You've Gone" for the end credits of the film The Cat's Meow (2001). Dunst was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, to Inez (née Rupprecht) and Klaus Dunst.
213005	She has one younger brother named Christian, born in 1986.
213006	Her father worked as a medical services executive, and her mother was an artist and one-time gallery owner.
213007	Dunst's father is German, originally from Hamburg, and Dunst's mother, who was born in New Jersey, is of German and Swedish descent (Dunst affirmed her German citizenship in 2011 and now holds passports as a dual citizen of the United States and Germany).
214000	Until the age of eight, Dunst lived in Brick Township, New Jersey, where she attended Ranney School.
214001	In 1991, her parents separated, and she subsequently moved with her mother and younger brother to Los Angeles, California, where she attended Laurel Hall School in North Hollywood.
214002	In 1995, her mother filed for divorce.
214003	The following year Dunst began attending Notre Dame High School, a private Catholic high school in Los Angeles.
214004	After graduating from Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst continued the acting career that she had begun.
214005	As a teenager, she found it difficult to deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child.
214006	However, she later expressed that her mother "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out ... I don't think anybody can sit around and say: 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues."
214007	Dunst began her career when she was three years old as a child fashion model in television commercials.
214008	She was signed with Ford Models and Elite Model Management.
214009	At the age of six years old she made her film debut in a minor role in Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks, a short film that was released as one-third of the anthology New York Stories (1989). Soon after, she landed a small part in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), as Tom Hanks's daughter.
214010	In 1993, Dunst played Hedril in "Dark Page", the seventh episode of the seventh season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
214011	The breakthrough role in Dunst's career came in Interview with the Vampire, a 1994 film based on Anne Rice's novel, in which she played the child vampire Claudia, a surrogate daughter to Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's characters in the film.
214012	The film received ambivalent reviews, but many film critics complimented Dunst's performance.
214013	Roger Ebert commented that Dunst's creation of the child vampire Claudia was one of the "creepier" aspects of the film, and mentioned her ability to convey the impression of great age inside apparent youth.
214014	Todd McCarthy in Variety noted that Dunst was "just right" for the family.
214015	The film featured a scene in which Dunst shared her first on-screen kiss with Brad Pitt, who was eighteen years her senior.
214016	In an interview with Interview magazine, she revealed, while questioned about her kissing scene with Pitt, that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: "I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties. I mean, I was 10."
214017	Her performance earned her the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress, and her first Golden Globe Award nomination.
215000	Later in 1994, Dunst appeared in the adaptation of the drama Little Women opposite Winona Ryder and Claire Danes.
215001	The film received favorable reviews.
215002	Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of the novel and remarked on Dunst's performance, "The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire, is a little vamp with a big future."
215003	In 1995, she appeared in the fantasy movie Jumanji, loosely based on Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 book of the same name.
215004	The story is about a supernatural and ominous board game which makes animals and other jungle hazards appear upon each roll of the dice.
215005	She was part of an ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, and David Alan Grier.
215006	The movie grossed $262 million worldwide.
215007	That year, and again in 2002, she was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.
215008	In 1996, Dunst had a recurring role in the third season of NBC's medical drama ER.
215009	She portrayed a child prostitute, Charlie Chiemingo, taken under the guidance of Dr. Doug Ross, played by George Clooney.
215010	In 1997, she was the voice of Young Anastasia in the animated musical film Anastasia.
215011	Also in 1997, Dunst appeared in the political satire Wag the Dog, opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman.
215012	The following year she was the voice of the title character, Kiki, a 13-year-old apprentice witch who leaves her home village to spend a year on her own, in the anime movie Kiki's Delivery Service (1998). Dunst was offered the role of Angela in the 1999 drama film American Beauty, but turned it down because she did not want to appear in the film's suggestive sexual scenes or kiss co-star Kevin Spacey.
215013	She later explained: "When I read it, I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to understand the script's material."
215014	That same year, she appeared in the comedy Dick, alongside Michelle Williams.
215015	The film is a parody retelling the events of the Watergate scandal which lead to the resignation of U.S. president Richard Nixon.
216000	In Sofia Coppola's independent film The Virgin Suicides (1999), Dunst played the role of troubled adolescent Lux Lisbon.
216001	The film was screened as a special presentation at the 43rd San Francisco International Film Festival in 2000.
216002	The movie received generally favorable reviews, and San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack noted in his review that Dunst "beautifully balances innocence and wantonness."
216003	In 2000, she played Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad in Bring It On.
216004	The film generated mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance.
216005	In his review, A.O. Scott called her "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt."
216006	Charles Taylor of Salon noted that "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides.
216007	Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick" and commenting that "[Dunst] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness."
216008	Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film."
216009	The following year, Dunst had the lead in the teen comedy Get Over It (2001). She later explained that one of the reasons for accepting the role was that it gave her the opportunity to sing.
216010	Also in 2001, she depicted the late American actress Marion Davies in The Cat's Meow, directed by Peter Bogdanovich.
216011	Derek Elley of Variety described the film as "playful and sporty," saying that this was Dunst's best performance to date: "Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy."
216012	In the Esquire review, Tom Carson called her performance "terrific."
216013	For her work, she won the Best Actress Silver Ombú category award at the 2002 Mar del Plata Film Festival.
217000	In the 2002 superhero film Spider-Man, the most successful film of her career to date, Dunst played Mary Jane Watson, the best friend and love interest of the title character, played by Tobey Maguire.
217001	The film was directed by Sam Raimi.
217002	Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly remarked on Dunst's ability to "lend even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music."
217003	In the Los Angeles Times review, critic Kenneth Turan noted that Dunst and Maguire made a real connection on screen, concluding that their relationship involved audiences to an extent rarely seen in films.
217004	Spider-Man was a commercial and critical success.
217005	The movie grossed $114 million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822 million worldwide.
217006	Following the success of Spider-Man, Dunst appeared in the independent drama Levity (2003), where she had a supporting role.
217007	That same year she starred in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). She was part of an ensemble cast that included Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles.
217008	The film generated mostly negative reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times describing it as "smug and reductive."
217009	She next appeared in the supporting role of Mary Svevo in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), alongside Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, and Tom Wilkinson.
217010	The latter film received very positive reviews, with Entertainment Weekly describing Dunst's subplot as "nifty and clever."
217011	The movie grossed $72 million worldwide.
217012	The success of the first Spider-Man film led Dunst to reprise the role in the 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2.
217013	The movie was well received by critics and a financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America.
217014	With revenue of $783 million worldwide, it was the second highest grossing film in 2004.
217015	Also in 2004, she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships opposite Paul Bettany, who played a fading former tennis star in the romantic comedy Wimbledon.
217016	Reception for the movie was mixed, but many critics enjoyed Dunst's performance.
217017	Claudia Puig of USA Today reported that the chemistry between Dunst and Bettany was potent, with Dunst doing a fine job as a sassy and self-assured player.
218000	In 2005, she appeared as flight attendant Claire Colburn alongside Orlando Bloom, in Elizabethtown, a movie written and directed by Cameron Crowe.
218001	The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto Film Festival.
218002	Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable, but more demanding than she had expected.
218003	The movie garnered mixed reviews, with the Chicago Tribune rating it one out of four stars and describing Dunst's portrayal of a flight attendant as "cloying."
218004	It was a box office disappointment.
218005	Dunst's next film role was the title character in the 2006 biographical film Marie Antoinette.
218006	Adapted from Antonia Fraser's book Marie Antoinette: The Journey, the film was Dunst's second with director Sofia Coppola.
218007	The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, and was reviewed favourably.
218008	International revenues were $45 million out of $60 million overall.
218009	In 2007 she again played Mary Jane Watson, in Spider-Man 3.
218010	In contrast to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics.
218011	Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891 million, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest grossing film to the end of 2008.
218012	Having initially signed on for three Spider-Man films, she revealed that she would do a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned.
218013	In January 2010 it was announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be restarted, therefore dropping Dunst, Maguire, and Raimi from the film series.
218014	In 2008, Dunst starred alongside Simon Pegg in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by former Vanity Fair contributing editor Toby Young.
218015	After she signed on to the film, she revealed that she had joined the project because Pegg was scheduled to appear in it.
219000	Since 2010, Dunst's work has included directing the short film Bastard which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010, and was later featured at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.
219001	Her next role was in a leading role opposite Ryan Gosling in the romantic drama All Good Things (2010) in which she portrays a woman from a run-down neighborhood who goes missing.
219002	The feature received reasonable reviews, and earned $640 thousand worldwide.
219003	In 2011, Dunst starred in Lars von Trier's science-fiction film Melancholia as a depressed woman at the end of the world.
219004	The film, which also stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
219005	The film received positive reviews and Dunst was singled out for praise.
219006	Steven Loeb of Southampton Patch wrote, "This film has brought the best out of von Trier, as well as his star. Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted... Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is, Dunst's performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it."
219007	Sukhdev Sandhu wrote from Cannes in The Daily Telegraph that "Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role - trouble, serene, a fierce savant - that it feels like a career breakthrough.
219008	Dunst won several awards for her performance, including the Best Actress Award at Cannes and the Best Actress Award from the US National Society of Film Critics Dunst has signed to appear in Sweet Relief as peace activist Marla Ruzicka, a U.S. relief worker killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad.

220012	In an interview with The Advertiser, Dunst explained that she has no plans to follow the steps of other actors who release albums, saying: "Definitely not. No way. It worked when Barbra Streisand was doing it, but now it's a little cheesy, I think. It works better when singers are in movies."
220013	Dunst starred as the magical princess Majokko in the Takashi Murakami and McG directed short Akihabara Majokko Princess singing a cover of "Turning Japanese". This was shown at the "Pop Life" exhibition in London's Tate Modern museum.
220014	It shows Dunst prancing around Akihabara, a crowded shopping district in Tokyo.
220015	The exhibition was held from October 1, 2009 to January 17, 2010 in London.
221000	Dunst was treated for depression in early 2008 at the Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah.

221002	In late March she checked out of the treatment center and began filming All Good Things.

221009	In support of this, she directed and narrated a documentary entitled Why Tuesday, explaining the United States tradition of voting on Tuesdays.

222000	Jackie Chan, SBS, MBE (born Chan Kong-sang, 7 April 1954) is a Hong Kong actor, action choreographer, comedian, director, producer, martial artist, screenwriter, entrepreneur, singer, and stunt performer.
222001	In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts.
222002	He is one of the few actors to have performed all of his film stunts.
222003	Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1960s and has appeared in over 150 films.
222004	Chan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
222005	As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games.
222006	An operatically trained vocalist, Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.
222007	Chan was born on 7 April 1954, in British Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War.
222008	He was nicknamed Pao-pao Chinese: 炮炮(literally meaning "Cannonball") because the high-energy child was always rolling around.
222009	Since his parents worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.
222010	Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.
222011	In 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen.
222012	Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics.
222013	He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master.
222014	Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons.
222015	After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to train in Hapkido under the grand master Jim Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a black belt.
223000	He began his career by appearing in small roles at the age of five.
223001	At the age of eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes", in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962), with Li Li Hua playing his mother.
223002	Chan appeared with Li again the following year, in The Love Eterne (1963) and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film, Come Drink with Me.
223003	In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another Kung Fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan began his adult career in the film industry, initially signing to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company.
223004	At the age of seventeen, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung (Chinese: 陳元龍). He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.
223005	Due to the commercial failures of his early ventures into films and trouble finding stunt work, in 1975 Chan starred in a comedic adult film, All in the Family, which features Jackie Chan's first nude sex scene filmed.
223006	It is also the only film he has made to date that did not feature a single fight scene or stunt sequence.
223007	Jackie Chan also appeared in a sex scene in the film The Shinjuku Incident, which was the only other nude scene that he ever filmed.
223008	Chan joined his parents in Canberra in 1976, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker.
223009	A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, earning Chan the nickname of "Little Jack" which was later shortened to "Jackie" and the name Jackie Chan has stuck with him ever since.
223010	In addition, in the late 90s, Chan changed his Chinese name to Fong Si-lung, since his father's original surname was Fong.
224000	In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stuntwork.
224001	Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei.
224002	Lo had seen Chan's performance in the John Woo film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury.
224003	His stage name was changed to Sing Lung (Chinese: 成龍, also transcribed as Cheng Long, literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name was Lei Siu-lung (Chinese: 李小龍, meaning "Little Dragon"). The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style.
224004	Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.
224005	Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal.
224006	Under director Yuen Woo-ping, Chan was allowed complete freedom over his stunt work.
224007	The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved to be a breath of fresh air for the Hong Kong audience.
224008	Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.
224009	Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of Drunken Master, producing Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Spiritual Kung Fu.
224010	He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct The Fearless Hyena with Kenneth Tsang.
224011	When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei.
224012	During the shooting of Fearless Hyena Part II, Chan broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest, prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with triads, blaming Willie for his star's departure.
224013	The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu, allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.
225000	Willie Chan had become Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years.
225001	He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s.
225002	His first Hollywood film was Battle Creek Brawl in 1980.
225003	Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run, which grossed US$100 million worldwide.
225004	Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.
225005	After the commercial failure of The Protector in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to Hong Kong films.
225006	Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia, with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including The Young Master (1980) and Dragon Lord (1982). The Young Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star.
225007	With Dragon Lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes for a single sequence of scenes with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.
225008	Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao.
225009	The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in Project A, which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards.
225010	Over the following two years, the "Three Brothers" appeared in Wheels on Meals and the original Lucky Stars trilogy.
225011	In 1985, Chan made the first Police Story film, a US-influenced action comedy in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts.
225012	It was named the "Best Film" at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards.
225013	In 1987, Chan played "Asian Hawk," an Indiana Jones-esque character, in the film Armour of God.
225014	The film was Chan's biggest domestic box office success up to that point, grossing over HK$35 million.
226000	In 1988 Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date, in the film Dragons Forever.
226001	Hung co-directed with Corey Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.
226002	In the late 1980s and early 90s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with Police Story 2, which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 Hong Kong Film Awards.
226003	This was followed by Armour of God II: Operation Condor, and Police Story 3: Super Cop, for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 Golden Horse Film Festival.
226004	In 1994, Chan reprised his role as Wong Fei-hung in Drunken Master II, which was listed in Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies.
226005	Another sequel, Police Story 4: First Strike, brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan, but did not fare as well in foreign markets.
226006	Jackie Chan rekindled his Hollywood ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being typecast in future roles.
226007	For example, Sylvester Stallone offered him the role of Simon Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film Demolition Man.
226008	Chan declined and the role was taken by Wesley Snipes.
226009	Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of Rumble in the Bronx, attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars.
226010	The success of Rumble in the Bronx led to a 1996 release of Police Story 3: Super Cop in the United States under the title Supercop, which grossed a total of US $16,270,600.
226011	Jackie's first huge blockbuster success came when he co-starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy Rush Hour, grossing US$130 million in the United States alone.
226012	This film made a star of Jackie Chan, in Hollywood.
226013	As a publicity stunt, Jackie also wrote his autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled I Am Jackie Chan.
227000	In 1998, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, Who Am I?.
227001	After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in Gorgeous a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences.
227002	Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture.
227003	He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy Shanghai Noon which spawned the sequel Shanghai Knights (2003). He reunited with Chris Tucker for Rush Hour 2 (2001) which was an even bigger success than the original grossing $347 million worldwide.
227004	He experimented with special effects with The Tuxedo (2002) and The Medallion (2003) which were not as successful critically or commercially.
227005	In 2004 he teamed up with Steve Coogan in the big-budget loose adaptation of Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days.
227006	Despite the success of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the film-making process.
227007	In response to Golden Harvest's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG). His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples include New Police Story (2004), The Myth (2005) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood (2006). Chan's next release was the third instalment in the Rush Hour series: Rush Hour 3 in August 2007.
227008	It grossed US$255 million.
227009	However, it was a disappointment in Hong Kong, grossing only HK$3.5 million during its opening weekend.
227010	Filming of The Forbidden Kingdom (released in 2008), Chan's first onscreen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008.
227011	The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires.
227012	Chan voiced Master Monkey in Kung Fu Panda (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie.
227013	In addition, he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer-director's film Wushu, released on 1 May 2008.
227014	The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son.
228000	In November 2007, Chan began filming Shinjuku Incident, a dramatic role featuring no martial arts sequences with director Derek Yee, which sees Chan take on the role of a Chinese immigrant in Japan.
228001	The film was released on 2 April 2009.
228002	According to his blog, Chan discussed his wishes to direct a film after completing Shinjuku Incident, something he has not done for a number of years.
228003	The film is expected to be the third in the Armour of God series, and has a working title of Armour of God III: Chinese Zodiac.
228004	Chan had completed shooting the movie and will be released on 12 December 2012.
228005	Because the Screen Actors Guild did not go on strike, Chan started shooting his next Hollywood movie The Spy Next Door at the end of October in New Mexico.
228006	In The Spy Next Door, Chan plays an undercover agent whose cover is blown when he looks after the children of his girlfriend.
228007	In Little Big Soldier, Chan stars, alongside Leehom Wang as a soldier in the Warring States Period in China.
228008	He is the lone survivor of his army and must bring a captured enemy soldier Leehom Wang to the capital of his province.
228009	On 22 June 2009, he left Los Angeles to begin filming The Karate Kid, a remake of the 1984 original, in Beijing.
228010	The film was released in America on 11 June 2010 and sees Chan's first dramatic American film.
228011	In the film, he plays Mr. Han, a kung fu master and maintenance man who teaches Jaden Smith's character, Dre, kung-fu so he can defend himself from school bullies.
228012	In Chan's next movie, Shaolin, he plays the cook of the temple instead of one of the major characters.
228013	His 100th movie 1911 was released on 26 September 2011.
228014	He is the co-director, executive producer, and lead star of the movie.
228015	While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this is his first directorial work in over ten years, since Jackie Chan's Who Am I? in 1998.
228016	1911 premiered in North America on 14 October.
229000	Chan won the Favorite Buttkicker award at the Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards in 2011 for The Karate Kid.
229001	While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he was getting too old for the genre.
229002	He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.
229003	In 1982, Jackie Chan married Lin Feng-Jiao (aka Joan Lin), a Taiwanese actress.
229004	That same year, the two had a son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan.
229005	Elaine Ng Yi-Lei had a daughter, Etta, in 1999, and claimed Chan was the father; Chan admitted the affair, but did not formally acknowledge her as his daughter.
229006	Chan is a Buddhist.
229007	He speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, American Sign Language, and English, and also speaks some German, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai.
229008	When he was 9 and 16 years of age, he lived in Thailand for a short period of time.
229009	During that time, he learned boxing from a former professional boxer who had a broken leg.
229010	In 2009, Chan received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambodia.
229011	Chan is an avid football fan and supports the Hong Kong National Football Team, England National Football Team, and Manchester City.
229012	Jackie Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team.
229013	He has stated in interviews that the primary inspiration for his more comedic stunts were films such as The General directed by and starring Buster Keaton, who was also known to perform his own stunts.
229014	Since its establishment in 1983, Chan has used the team in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.
229015	Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.
230000	The dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult for Chan to get insurance, especially in the United States, where his stunt work is contractually limited.
230001	Chan holds the Guinness World Record for "Most Stunts by a Living Actor", which emphasizes "no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions in which he performs all his own stunts". In addition, he holds an unrecognised record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film, having shot over 2900 retakes for a complex scene involving a Jianzi game in Dragon Lord.
230002	Chan has been injured numerous times attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films.
230003	He came closest to death filming Armour of God, when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull.
230004	Over the years, Chan has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs on numerous occasions.
230005	Promotional materials for Rumble in the Bronx emphasised that Chan performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.
230006	Jackie Chan created his screen persona as a response to Bruce Lee, and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death.
230007	In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.
230008	Additionally, Chan has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy.
230009	Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie, nor understands American humour.
231000	In recent years, the ageing Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films.
231001	In New Police Story, he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues.
231002	To further shed the image of Mr. Nice Guy, Chan played an anti-hero for the first time in Rob-B-Hood starring as Thongs, a burglar with gambling problems.
231003	In 2000, Chan hosted a fictionalised version of himself in the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures, which ran until 2005.
231004	In July 2008, the BTV reality television series entitled The Disciple Jackie Chan Traditional Chinese 龍的傳人 Simplified Chinese 龙的传人 Transcriptions (lit. "Disciple of the Dragon") concluded.
231005	The series was produced by, and featured Jackie Chan.
231006	The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan's "successor" and student in filmmaking.
231007	Contestants were trained by Jackie Chan Stunt Team members Alan Wu and He Jun and competed in various fields, including explosion scenes, high-altitude wire-suspension, gunplay, car stunts, diving, obstacles courses etc.
231008	The regular judges on the program were He Ping, Wu Yue and Cheng Pei Pei.
231009	Guest judges include Stanley Tong, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao.
231010	The "Finals" began on 5 April 2008, with 16 contestants remaining, and concluded on 26 June 2008.
231011	Amongst those in attendance were Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ng See Yuen and Yu Rongguang.
231012	The winner of the series was Jack Tu (Tu Sheng Cheng). Along with runners up Yang Zheng and Jerry Liau, Tu is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films, one of which was scripted by Chan, and all three will be co-produced by Chan and his company JCE Movies Limited.
231013	The films will be entitled Speedpost 206, Won't Tell You and Tropical Tornado and will be directed by Xie Dong, Jiang Tao and Cai Rong Hui.
231014	All 16 finalists will be given the opportunity to work on the films, or to join the Jackie Chan Stunt Team.
231015	Production on the first film is due to begin in September 2008.
231016	In addition, the finalists will be given roles in a forthcoming BTV action series.
232000	Jackie Chan had vocal lessons whilst at the Peking Opera School in his childhood.
232001	He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia.
232002	He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese and English.
232003	He often sings the theme songs of his films, which play over the closing credits.
232004	Chan's first musical recording was "Kung Fu Fighting Man", the theme song played over the closing credits of The Young Master (1980). At least 10 of these recordings have been released on soundtrack albums for the films.
232005	His Cantonese song Story of a Hero (英雄故事) (theme song of Police Story) was selected by the Royal Hong Kong Police and incorporated into their recruitment advertisement in 1994.
232006	Chan voiced the character of Shang in the Chinese release of the Walt Disney animated feature, Mulan (1998). He also performed the song "I'll Make a Man Out of You", for the film's soundtrack.
232007	For the US release, the speaking voice was performed by B.D. Wong and the singing voice was done by Donny Osmond.
232008	In 2007, Chan recorded and released the song "We Are Ready", the official one-year countdown song to the 2008 Summer Olympics.
232009	He performed the song at a ceremony marking the one-year countdown to the 2008 Summer Paralympics.
232010	The day before the Beijing Olympics opened, Chan released one of the two official Olympics albums, Official Album for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games - Jackie Chan's Version, which featured a number of special guest appearances.
232011	Chan, along with Andy Lau, Liu Huan and Wakin (Emil) Chau, performed "Hard to Say Goodbye", the farewell song for the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.
232012	Jackie Chan has received worldwide recognition for his acting, having won several awards including an Innovator Award from the American Choreography Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards.
232013	He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars.
232014	Despite considerable box office success in The Northsouth Territories, Chan's American films have been criticised with regard to their action choreography.
232015	Reviewers of Rush Hour 2, The Tuxedo, and Shanghai Knights criticised the toning down of Chan's fighting scenes, citing less intensity compared to his earlier films.
232016	The comedic value of his films is questioned; some critics stated it can be childish at times.
233000	Chan is a cultural icon, having been referenced in Ash's song "Kung Fu", Heavy Vegetable's "Jackie Chan Is a Punk Rocker", Leehom Wang's "Long Live Chinese People", as well as in "Jackie Chan" by Frank Chickens, and television shows Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Celebrity Deathmatch and Family Guy.
233001	He has been the inspiration for manga such as Dragon Ball (including a character with the alias "Jackie Chun"), the character Lei Wulong in Tekken and the fighting-type Pokémon Hitmonchan.
233002	In addition, Jackie Chan has a sponsorship deal with Mitsubishi Motors.
233003	As a result, Mitsubishi cars can be found in a number of Jackie Chan films.
233004	Furthermore, Mitsubishi honoured Chan by launching Evolution, a limited series of cars which he personally customised.
233005	A number of video games have featured Jackie Chan.
233006	Before Stuntmaster, Chan already had a game of his own, Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu, released in 1990 for the PC-Engine and NES.
233007	In 1995, Chan was featured in the arcade fighting game Jackie Chan The Kung-Fu Master.
233008	In addition, a series of Japanese Jackie Chan games were released on the MSX by Pony, based on several of his films (Project A, Project A 2, Police Story, The Protector and Wheels On Meals). Chan has always wanted to be a role model to children, remaining popular with them due to his good-natured acting style.
233009	He has generally refused to play villains and has almost never used the word "fuck" in his films (He's only said that word in two films, The Protector and Burn, Hollywood, Burn), but in Rush Hour, in an attempt to be "cool" and imitate his partner Carter, who said "What's up, my nigga?" to a club of black men, he said the same thing when Carter was in another room and they all attacked him, so he had to pull out his fighting skills to beat them down and escape.
233010	Chan's greatest regret in life is not having received proper education, inspiring him to fund educational institutions around the world.
233011	He funded the construction of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the Australian National University and the establishment of schools in poor regions of China.
234000	Chan is a spokesperson for the Government of Hong Kong, appearing in public service announcements.
234001	In a Clean Hong Kong commercial, he urged the people of Hong Kong to be more considerate with regards to littering, a problem that has been widespread for decades.
234002	Furthermore, in an advertisement promoting nationalism, he gave a short explanation of the March of the Volunteers, the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.
234003	When Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005, Chan participated in the opening ceremony.
234004	In the United States, Chan appeared alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in a government advert to combat copyright infringement and made another public service announcement with Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to encourage people, especially Asians, to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
234005	Construction has begun on a Jackie Chan museum in Shanghai.
234006	Work began in July 2008, and although it was scheduled to be completed on October 2009, construction continues as of January 2010.
234007	During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004, Chan referred to the recently concluded Republic of China presidential election, 2004 in Taiwan, in which Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu were re-elected as President and Vice-President as "the biggest joke in the world."
234008	Chan's comments were criticised by Parris Chang, a Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP, who called for the government of Taiwan to take punitive steps against Chan for his comments, such as banning his movies and barring him the right to visit Taiwan.
234009	Some 50 police and security personnel were required to separate protesters from Chan, as they were attempting to spit at him when he arrived at Taipei airport for a charity sponsored by cable TV channel TVBS on 18 June 2008.
234010	Chan insisted that his remarks were not intended to insult the people of Taiwan.
235000	Referring to his participation in the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government, including China's human rights record and the political status of Taiwan.
235001	He warned that he would lash out against anyone planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch, saying, "Demonstrators better not get anywhere near me."
235002	In addition, Chan felt that the protesters were publicity seekers. "
235003	They are doing it for no reason. They just want to show off on the TV," he said. "They know, 'if I can get the torch, I can go on the TV for the world news'." Chan felt the country was trying to improve and the Olympics is a chance for the country to open up and learn from the outside world and vice versa. "
235004	We are not right about everything. Things are getting better in China but we can change and are changing. We want to learn from the rest of the world as well as teach others about our ways and our culture."
235005	On 18 April 2009, during a panel discussion at the annual Boao Forum for Asia titled "Tapping into Asia's Creative Industry Potential," Chan said "...in the 10 years after Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, I can gradually see, I'm not sure if it's good to have freedom or not."
235006	Chan went on to say, "If you're too free, you're like the way Hong Kong is now. It's very chaotic. Taiwan is also chaotic."
235007	He also added, "I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want."
235008	Chan however complained about the quality of Chinese goods, saying, "...a Chinese TV might explode."
235009	but refrained from criticising the Chinese government for banning his 2009 film Shinjuku Incident.
235010	Chan's comments prompted an angry response from some legislators and other prominent figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
235011	Hong Kong Legislator Leung Kwok-hung said that Chan "insulted the Chinese people. Chinese people aren't pets."
235012	The Hong Kong Tourism Board stated that it had received 164 comments and complaints from the public over Chan's remarks.
235013	A spokesman for Chan told reporters that the actor was referring to freedom in the entertainment industry rather than Chinese society at large and that certain people with "ulterior motives deliberately misinterpreted what he said."
236000	On 24 August 2010, Chan tweeted about the botched rescue operation on the Manila hostage crisis that left 8 Hong Kong tourists dead.
236001	Although saddened by the news, he also tweeted "If they killed the guy sooner, they will say why not negotiate first? If they negotiate first, they ask why not kill the guy sooner?"
236002	Chan's comments caused outrage in Hong Kong.
236003	Several anti-Jackie Chan groups were set up on Facebook with tens of thousands of supporters.
236004	Some fellow actors and directors told local newspapers that they were also upset by his remarks.
236005	Chan reportedly has business interests in the Philippines.
236006	He issued a statement on 27 August 2010 apologising for his comments and claiming that his assistant who helped him post the tweets had misunderstood the meaning of his original message.
236007	In December 2012, Chan caused outrage when he criticized Hong Kong as a "city of protest", suggesting that demonstrators' rights in Hong Kong should be limited.
236008	The same month, in an interview with Phoenix TV, Chan dubbed the United States as the "most corrupt" country in the world.
236009	In addition to his film production and distribution company, JCE Movies Limited, Jackie Chan also owns or co-owns the production companies JC Group China, Jackie & Willie Productions (with Willie Chan) and Jackie & JJ Productions.
236010	Chan has also put his name to Jackie Chan Theater International, a cinema chain in China, co-run by Hong Kong company Sparkle Roll Group Ltd.
236011	The first-Jackie Chan-Yaolai International Cinema-opened in February 2010, and is claimed to be the largest cinema complex in China, with 17 screens and 3,500 seats.
236012	Chan expressed his hopes that the size of the venue would afford young, non-commercial directors the opportunity to have their films screened.
236013	15 further cinemas in the chain are planned for 2010, throughout Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with a potential total of 65 cinemas throughout the country proposed.
237000	In 2004, Chan launched his own line of clothing, which bears a Chinese dragon logo and the English word "Jackie", or the initials "JC". Chan also has a number of other branded businesses.
237001	His sushi restaurant chain, Jackie's Kitchen, has outlets throughout Hong Kong, as well as seven in South Korea and one in Hawaii, with plans to open another in Las Vegas.
237002	Jackie Chan's Cafe has outlets in Beijing, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and the Philippines.
237003	Other ventures include Jackie Chan Signature Club gyms (a partnership with California Fitness), and a line of chocolates, cookies and nutritional oatcakes.
237004	He also hopes to expand into furniture and kitchenware, and is also considering a branded supermarket.
237005	With each of his businesses, a percentage of the profits goes to various charities, including the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation.
237006	Chan is a keen philanthropist and a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, having worked tirelessly to champion charitable works and causes.
237007	He has campaigned for conservation, against animal abuse and has promoted disaster relief efforts for floods in mainland China and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.
237008	In June 2006, he announced the donation of half his assets to charity upon his death, citing his admiration of the effort made by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to help those in need.
237009	On 10 March 2008, Chan was the guest of honour for the launch, by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University in Canberra.
237010	Jackie Chan is also a supporter of the Save China's Tigers project which aims at saving the endangered South China Tiger through breeding and releasing them into the wild; he is currently an ambassador for this conservation project.
237011	Chan has many historic artefacts, such as old door frames from 2000 years ago.
237012	He also owns the Jinricksha Station in Singapore.
238000	In April 2008, Jackie Chan was invited for the audio launch of an Indian film, entitled Dasavathaaram (2008) in Chennai (Madras), where he shared the dais with Indian celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, Mammootty and Kamal Hassan.
238001	Though he did not understand a word of Tamil, Chan was touched by the Indian community's love for him and his films, and was impressed with the movie Dasavathaaram, expressing a keen interest in working with the star of the film, Kamal Hassan.
238002	Hassan himself reciprocated the desire to work with the action superstar, urging Chan to keep his promise of working with him on a possible film project.
238003	Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Chan donated RMB ¥10 million to help those in need.
238004	In addition, he is planning to make a film about the Chinese earthquake to raise money for survivors.
238005	In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Jackie Chan and fellow Hong Kong-based celebrities, including American rapper Jin, headlined a special three-hour charity concert, titled Artistes 311 Love Beyond Borders, on 1 April 2011 to help with Japan's disaster recovery effort, where Jackie Chan addressed the victims of the earthquake and tsunami by saying: "You will not be alone, we will be by your side". The concert raised over $3.3 million dollars in just three hours for disaster relief.
238006	Chan also holds guest lectures at the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art of Fudan University, Shanghai.
243000	Ethan Green Hawke (born November 6, 1970) is an American actor, writer and director.
243001	He made his feature film debut in 1985 with the science fiction movie Explorers, before making a supporting appearance in the 1989 drama Dead Poets Society, which is considered his breakthrough role.
243002	He then appeared in such films as White Fang (1991), A Midnight Clear (1992), and Alive (1993) before taking a role in the 1994 Generation X drama Reality Bites, for which he gained critical acclaim.
243003	In 1995, he starred in the romantic drama Before Sunrise, and later in the 2004 sequel Before Sunset.
243004	In 2001, Hawke was cast as a rookie police officer in Training Day, for which he received a Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.
243005	Other films have included the science fiction feature Gattaca (1997), the title role in Michael Almereyda's Hamlet (2000), the action thriller Assault on Precinct 13 (2005), and the crime drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007). Hawke has appeared in many theater productions including The Seagull, Henry IV, Hurlyburly, The Cherry Orchard, The Winter's Tale and The Coast of Utopia, for which he earned a Tony Award nomination.
243006	He made his directorial debut with the 2002 independent feature Chelsea Walls.
243007	In November 2007 Hawke directed his first play, Jonathan Marc Sherman's Things We Want.
243008	Aside from acting, he has written two novels, The Hottest State (1996) and Ash Wednesday (2002). Between 1998 and 2004, Hawke was married to actress Uma Thurman.
243009	Hawke was born in Austin, Texas, to Leslie (née Green), a charity worker, and James Hawke, an insurance actuary.
243010	His maternal grandfather, Howard Lemuel Green, served five terms in the Texas Legislature and was a minor-league baseball commissioner.
243011	Hawke's parents were students at the University of Texas at the time of his birth, and separated in 1974.
244000	After the separation, Hawke was raised by his mother.
244001	The two relocated several times before settling in New York, where Hawke attended the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights.
244002	Hawke's mother remarried when he was 10 and the family moved to West Windsor Township, New Jersey, where Hawke attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South.
244003	He later transferred to the Hun School of Princeton, a secondary boarding school, from which he graduated in 1988.
244004	In high school, Hawke aspired to be a writer, but developed an interest in acting.
244005	He made his stage debut at age 13, in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, and appearances in West Windsor-Plainsboro High School productions of Meet Me in St. Louis and You Can't Take It with You followed.
244006	At Hun School he took acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus, and after high school graduation he studied acting at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, eventually dropping out after he was cast in Dead Poets Society (1989). He twice enrolled in New York University's English program, but dropped out both times to pursue acting roles.
244007	Hawke obtained his mother's permission to attend his first casting call at age 14.
244008	He secured his first film role in 1985's Explorers, in which he played alongside River Phoenix as an alien-obsessed schoolboy who builds a spacecraft with his friends.
244009	The film received favorable reviews but made poor box office revenues, a failure which Hawke has admitted caused him to quit acting for a brief period after the film's release.
244010	Hawke later described the disappointment as difficult to bear at such a young age, adding "I would never recommend that a kid act."
244011	His next film appearance was not until 1989's comedy drama Dad, where he played Ted Danson's son and Jack Lemmon's grandson.
245000	In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance, playing shy student Todd Anderson opposite Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher in Dead Poets Society.
245001	The film was critically well-received; the Variety reviewer wrote "Hawke ... gives a haunting performance."
245002	With revenue of $235 million worldwide, the film remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date.
245003	Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: "I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the [film's] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else."
245004	Hawke's next film, 1991's White Fang, brought his first leading role.
245005	The film, an adaptation of Jack London's novel of the same name, featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a Yukon gold hunter who befriends a wolfdog.
245006	According to The Oregonian, "Hawke does a good job as young Jack, being both physically robust but still boyishly naive. He makes Jack's passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental."
245007	Hawke then appeared in A Midnight Clear (1992), a well-received war film by Keith Gordon, and 1993's Alive, an adaptation of Piers Paul Read's 1974 book, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors.
245008	Hawke's next part, in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994) as Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love interest (played by Winona Ryder), received critical acclaim.
245009	Film critic Roger Ebert called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: "Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy."
245010	The New York Times noted, "Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all."
245011	Nonetheless, the film was a surprise box office disappointment.
246000	The following year Hawke again received critical praise, this time for his performance in Richard Linklater's 1995 drama Before Sunrise.
246001	The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another.
246002	The San Francisco Chronicle praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: "[they] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances."
246003	Apart from acting, Hawke directed the music video for the 1994 song "Stay (I Missed You)" by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb.
246004	He also published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer.
246005	Hawke said of the novel, "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did."
246006	The book met with a mixed reception.
246007	Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious ... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues, perhaps focusing on shorter stories and submitting them to little magazines."
246008	The New York Times thought Hawke did "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately "a sweet love story". In Andrew Niccol's science fiction film Gattaca (1997), "one of the more interesting scripts" Hawke said he had read in "a number of years", Hawke played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity in order to realize his dream of space travel.
246009	Although Gattaca was not a success at the box office it drew generally favorable reviews from critics, and Hawke's performance was critically well-received.
246010	The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reviewer wrote that "Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive". 1998 saw Hawke appearing in Great Expectations, a contemporary film adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel, and collaborating for a second time with director Richard Linklater in The Newton Boys, based on the true story of the Newton Gang, a family of bank robbers from Uvalde, Texas.
247000	In 1999 Hawke starred in Snow Falling on Cedars, in which he played a reporter named Ishmael Chambers, who, after being wounded in World War II, comes home to take over his family newspaper after his father's death.
247001	The film, based on David Guterson's novel of the same title, received ambivalent reviews and Entertainment Weekly concluded, "Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we have no idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does."
247002	He also appeared that year in Frank Whaley's directorial debut, Joe the King (1999). Hawke's next film role was in Michael Almereyda's 2000 film Hamlet, in which he played the title character.
247003	The film transposed the famous William Shakespeare play to contemporary New York City, a technique Hawke felt made the play more "accessible and vital". Salon reviewer wrote: "Hawke certainly isn't the greatest Hamlet of living memory ... but his performance reinforces Hamlet's place as Shakespeare's greatest character. And in that sense, he more than holds his own in the long line of actors who've played the part."
247004	In 2001, Hawke appeared in two more Linklater movies: Waking Life and Tape, both critically acclaimed.
247005	In the animated Waking Life, he shared a single scene with former co-star Julie Delpy continuing conversations begun in Before Sunrise.
247006	The real-time drama Tape, based on a play from Stephen Belber, took place entirely in a single motel room with three characters played by Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman.
247007	Hawke regarded Tape as his "first adult performance", a performance noted by Roger Ebert for its "physical and verbal acting mastery". Hawke's next role, and one for which he received substantial critical acclaim, came in Training Day (2001). Hawke played rookie cop Jake Hoyt, alongside Denzel Washington, as one of a pair of narcotics detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department spending 24 hours in the gang neighborhoods of South Los Angeles.
247008	The film was a box office hit, taking $104 million worldwide, and garnered generally favorable reviews.
247009	Variety wrote that Hawke's part "shows signs of coming to new life as a screen actor after somnolent turns in the likes of Snow Falling on Cedars. Hawke adds feisty and cunning flourishes to his part that allow him to respectably hold his own under formidable circumstances."
247010	Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Hawke's performance was "totally believable as a doe-eyed rookie going toe-to-toe with a legend [Washington]". Hawke himself described Training Day as his "best experience in Hollywood". His performance earned him Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.
248000	Hawke pursued a number of projects away from acting throughout the early 2000s.
248001	He made his directorial feature debut with Chelsea Walls (2002), an independent drama about five struggling artists living in the famed Chelsea Hotel in New York City.
248002	Upon its release, the feature received mixed reviews; The Los Angeles Times wrote that Hawke's directorial debut "has brought Nicolette Burdette's play to the screen with fluid grace and a perfect blend of dreaminess and grit", while The Boston Globe stated that his direction is not apparent in Chelsea Walls.
248003	The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.
248004	A second novel, 2002's Ash Wednesday, was better received and made the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction.
248005	The tale of an AWOL soldier and his pregnant girlfriend, between whose perspectives the narrative alternates, the novel attracted critical praise: The Guardian called it "sharply and poignantly written ... makes for an intense one-sitting read". The New York Times noted that in the book Hawke displayed "a novelist's innate gifts ... a sharp eye, a fluid storytelling voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals", but was "weaker at narrative tricks that can be taught". In 2003 Hawke made a television appearance, guest starring in the second season of the television series Alias, where he portrayed a mysterious Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent.
248006	In 2004 Hawke returned to film, starring in two features, Taking Lives and Before Sunset.
248007	In Taking Lives opposite Angelina Jolie, he played a man who could identify a serial killer who had been assuming the identity of his victims.
248008	Director D. J. Caruso's decision to cast Hawke was based on the "vulnerability" he displayed in Training Day and believed he could do the same with his character.
248009	Upon release, Taking Lives received broadly negative reviews.
248010	Despite the film's reception, Hawke's performance was favored by critics; the Star Tribune noted that Hawke "plays a complex character persuasively". Before Sunset, the Linklater-directed sequel to Before Sunrise which Hawke co-wrote with Linklater and Delpy, was more successful, with a contributor of The Hartford Courant reporting that the three collaborators keep Hawke and Delpy's characters "iridescent and fresh", concluding that they are the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples.
248011	Hawke called it one of his favorite movies, a "romance for realists". Before Sunset was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, Hawke's first screenwriting Oscar nomination.
249000	2005 saw Hawke star in the action thriller Assault on Precinct 13, a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot.
249001	Hawke played Sergeant Jake Roenick, a Detroit policeman working desk duty in a rundown police station.
249002	Assault on Precinct 13 received reasonable reviews; some critics praised the dark swift feel of the film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter's original.
249003	Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller Lord of War, playing an Interpol agent chasing an arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage.
249004	In 2006 Hawke was cast in a supporting role in the film Fast Food Nation, an adaptation by Linklater and Eric Schlosser of Schlosser's best-selling 2001 non-fiction book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal.
249005	The same year Hawke directed his second feature, The Hottest State, based on his eponymous 1996 novel.
249006	The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Venice International Film Festival and was released in theaters to a tepid reception in 2007.
249007	Hawke then appeared alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney in Sidney Lumet's crime drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007). Hawke played an ex-husband in desperate need of child support who decides to rob his parent's jewelry store with his brother (Hoffman), with disastrous consequences.
249008	Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Hawke's performance, noting that he "digs deep to create a haunting portrayal of loss". USA Today called the movie "highly entertaining", describing Hawke and Hoffman's performances as excellent.
249009	In 2008 Hawke starred with Mark Ruffalo in the crime drama What Doesn't Kill You.
249010	Despite the favorable reception, the film was not given a proper theatrical release due to the bankruptcy of its distributor.
249011	2009 saw Hawke appear in two features: New York, I Love You, a romance movie comprising 12 short films, and Staten Island, a crime drama co-starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Seymour Cassel.
249012	The following year he starred as a vampire researcher trying to save humanity from extinction in the horror-thriller Daybreakers (2010). The feature received reasonable reviews, and earned $51 million worldwide.
249013	His next role was in Brooklyn's Finest, released in March 2010, as a narcotics officer who uses his position to steal drug money and administer vigilante justice.
249014	The film opened to a mediocre reception, yet his performance was well-received, with the New York Daily News concluding, "Hawke - continuing an evolution toward stronger, more intense acting than anyone might've predicted from him 20 years ago - drives the movie."
250000	In a television adaptation of the Herman Melville novel Moby-Dick, Hawke played the role of Starbuck, the first officer to William Hurt's Captain Ahab.
250001	The two-part miniseries aired on Encore in August 2011.
250002	He then starred opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in Pawel Pawlikowski's The Woman in the Fifth, a "lush puzzler" about an American novelist struggling to rebuild his life in Paris.
250003	The following year he played a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's horror-thriller Sinister, released in October 2012.
250004	Hawke has wrapped production on the third entry to Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series.
250005	The film, entitled Before Midnight, is expected to be released in 2013.
250006	It was announced that Hawke had signed on to Universal's futurist thriller Vigilandia and the Spierig brothers' science fiction film Predestination.
250007	Hawke has described theater as his "first love", a place where he is "free to be more creative". Hawke made his Broadway debut in 1992, portraying the playwright Konstantin Treplev in Anton Chekhov's The Seagull at the Lyceum Theater in Manhattan.
250008	The following year Hawke was a co-founder and the artistic director of Malaparte, a Manhattan theater company, which survived until 2000.
250009	Outside of the New York stage, Hawke made an appearance in a 1995 production of Sam Shepard's Buried Child, directed by Gary Sinise at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago.
250010	In 1999, he starred as Kilroy in the Tennessee Williams play Camino Real at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.
250011	Hawke returned to Broadway in Jack O'Brien's 2003 production of Henry IV, playing Henry Percy, also called Harry Hotspur.
250012	New York magazine wrote: "Ethan Hawke's Hotspur ... is a compelling, ardent creation."
250013	Ben Brantley of the New York Times reported that Hawke's interpretation of Hotspur was "too contemporary for some tastes. It's hard to credit him as the embodiment of an older order of chivalry", but allowed "[He's] great fun to watch as he fumes and fulminates."
250014	In April 2005 Hawke starred in the Off-Broadway revival of David Rabe's dark comedy Hurlyburly.
250015	New York Times critic Ben Brantley praised Hawke's performance as the central character Eddie, reporting that "he captures with merciless precision the sense of a sharp mind turning flaccid". The performance earned Hawke a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor.
251000	In November 2006, Hawke starred as Mikhail Bakunin in Tom Stoppard's The Coast of Utopia, a nine-hour long production, at the Lincoln Center in New York.
251001	Reviewing the production the Los Angeles Times complimented Hawke's take on Bakunin, writing: "Ethan Hawke buzzes in and out as Bakunin, a strangely appealing enthusiast on his way to becoming a famous anarchist."
251002	The performance earned Hawke his first Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play.
251003	In November 2007 he directed Things We Want, a two-act play by Jonathan Marc Sherman, for the artist-driven Off-Broadway company The New Group.
251004	The play concerns four characters, three of whom are alcoholics.
251005	The production starred Paul Dano, Peter Dinklage, Josh Hamilton, and Zoe Kazan.
251006	The Variety reviewer wrote: "While Ethan Hawke uses the space confidently, he allows his talented cast to push mannered material further into self-consciousness."
251007	New York magazine praised Hawke's "understated direction", particularly his ability to "steer a gifted cast away from the histrionics". The following year Hawke received the Michael Mendelson Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Theater.
251008	In his acceptance speech Hawke said "I don't know why they're honoring me. I think the real reason they are honoring me is to help raise money for the theater company. Whenever the economy gets hit hard, one of the first thing [sic] to go is people's giving, and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it's not essential. I guess I'm here to remind people that the arts are essential to our mental health as a country."
251009	In 2009 Hawke appeared in two plays under British director Sam Mendes: as Trofimov in Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, and as Autolycus in Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale.
251010	The two productions, launched in New York as part of the Bridge Project, went on a transatlantic tour in six countries from January to August.
251011	The Cherry Orchard won a mixed review from the New York Daily News, which wrote "Ethan Hawke ... fits the image of the 'mangy' student Trofimov, but one wishes he didn't speak with a perennial frog in his throat."
251012	Hawke's performance in The Winter's Tale earned him a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play.
252000	In January 2010 Hawke directed his second play, A Lie of the Mind, by Sam Shepard on the New York stage.
252001	It was the first major Off-Broadway revival of the play since its 1985 premiere.
252002	Hawke said that he was drawn to the play's take on "the nature of reality", and its "weird juxtaposition of humor and mysticism". In his review for the New York Times, Ben Brantley noted the production's "scary, splendid clarity", and praised Hawke for providing his cast "with a mood-stirring mise en scène" and, moreover, for eliciting a performance that "connoisseurs of precision acting will be savoring for years to come". Entertainment Weekly commented that although A Lie of the Mind "wobbles a bit in its late stages", Hawke's "hearty" revival managed to "resurrect the spellbinding uneasiness of the original". The production garnered five Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Revival, and earned Hawke a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Director of a Play.
252003	Hawke next starred in the Off-Broadway production of a new play, Tommy Nohilly's Blood from a Stone, from December 2010 to February 2011.
252004	The play, about the collapse of a blue-collar family, was not a critical success, but Hawke's portrayal of the central character Travis earned positive feedback; The New York Times said he was "remarkably good at communicating the buried sensitivity beneath Travis's veneer of wary resignation."
252005	A contributor from the New York Post noted it was Hawke's "best performance in years". Hawke won an Obie Award for his role in Blood from a Stone.
252006	In October 2012 Hawke returned to the New York stage to play the title role in Chekhov's Ivanov at the Classic Stage Company.
252007	The production began previews on October 17, with a closing date on December 9.
252008	Subsequently, he is set to star in and direct a new play, Clive by Jonathan Marc Sherman.
252009	The play, inspired by Bertolt Brecht's Baal, centers on the life of a dissolute songwriter in 1990s New York.
253000	On May 1, 1998, Hawke married actress Uma Thurman, whom he met on the set of Gattaca in 1997.
253001	Their relationship bore two offspring: daughter Maya, born in 1998, and son Levon, born in 2002.
253002	The couple separated in 2003, amid allegations of Hawke's infidelity, and filed for divorce the following year.
253003	Hawke married for a second time in June 2008, wedding Ryan Hawke (née Shawhughes), who had briefly worked as a nanny to his and Thurman's children before graduating from Columbia University.
253004	They have two daughters: Clementine Jane, born in 2008, and Indiana, born in 2011.
253005	Hawke is a long-time supporter of the Doe Fund which helps homeless people obtain housing and employment.
253006	He has served as a co-chair of the New York Public Library's Young Lions Committee, one of New York's major philanthropic boards.
253007	In 2001 Hawke co-founded the Young Lions Fiction Award, an annual prize for achievements in fiction writing by authors under age 35.
253008	In November 2010, he was honored as a Library Lion by the New York Public Library.
253009	Hawke is also an activist for gay rights and in March 2011, he and his wife released a video pressing for marriage equality in New York State.
253010	Same sex marriage was ultimately legalized in New York on June 24, 2011.
253011	Hawke lives in Chelsea, a Manhattan neighborhood in New York City, and owns a small island in Nova Scotia.
253012	Hawke is a relative of Tennessee Williams: Williams was his great-uncle on his father's side.
253013	He supports the United States Democratic Party, and supported Bill Bradley, John Kerry and Barack Obama for President of the United States in 2000, 2004 and 2008, respectively.
28000	While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.
28001	Pitt's onscreen career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out, No Man's Land and Less Than Zero.
28002	His television debut came in May 1987 with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.
28003	In November of the same year Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.
28004	He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall). Pitt described his character as "an idiot boyfriend who gets caught in the hay."
28005	Speaking of his scenes with McCall, Pitt later said, "It was kind of wild, because I'd never even met her before."
28006	Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.
28007	In the same year, the Yugoslavian-U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition.

376011	On his 13th birthday, Gyllenhaal performed a "bar mitzvah-like act, without the typical trappings", volunteering at a homeless shelter, because his parents wanted to instill in him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle.
376012	His parents insisted that he have summer jobs to support himself, and he thus worked as a lifeguard and as a busboy at a restaurant operated by a family friend.
377000	As a child, Gyllenhaal was regularly exposed to filmmaking due to his family's deep ties to the industry.
377001	He made his acting debut as Billy Crystal's son in the 1991 comedy film City Slickers.
377002	His parents did not allow him to appear in the 1992 film The Mighty Ducks because it would have required his leaving home for two months.
377003	In subsequent years, his parents allowed him to audition for parts, but regularly forbade him to take them if he were chosen.
377004	He was allowed to appear in his father's films several times.
377005	Gyllenhaal appeared in the 1993 film A Dangerous Woman (along with sister Maggie); in "Bop Gun" a 1994 episode of Homicide: Life on the Street; and in the 1998 comedy Homegrown.
377006	Along with their mother, Jake and Maggie appeared in two episodes of Molto Mario, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network.
377007	Prior to his senior year in high school, the only other film not directed by his father, in which Gyllenhaal was allowed to perform, was the 1993 film Josh and S.A.M., a little-known children's adventure.
377008	Gyllenhaal graduated from the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles in 1998, then attended Columbia University, where his sister was a senior and from which his mother had graduated, to study Eastern religions and philosophy.
377009	Gyllenhaal dropped out after two years to concentrate on acting, but has expressed intentions to eventually finish his degree.
377010	Gyllenhaal's first lead role was in October Sky, Joe Johnston's 1999 adaptation of the Homer Hickam autobiography Rocket Boys, in which he portrayed a young man from West Virginia striving to win a science scholarship to avoid becoming a coal miner.
377011	The film earned $32 million and was described in the Sacramento News and Review as Gyllenhaal's "breakout performance."
377012	Donnie Darko, Gyllenhaal's second major film, was not a box office success upon its initial 2001 release, but eventually became a cult favorite.
377013	The film, directed by Richard Kelly, is set in 1988 and stars Gyllenhaal as a troubled teenager who, after narrowly escaping death, experiences visions of a 6 foot (1.8 m) tall rabbit named Frank who tells him that the world is coming to an end.
377014	Gyllenhaal's performance was well received by critics; Gary Mairs of Culture Vulture wrote that "Gyllenhaal manages the difficult trick of seeming both blandly normal and profoundly disturbed, often within the same scene."
378000	After the critical success of Donnie Darko, Gyllenhaal's next role was as Pilot Kelston in 2002's Highway alongside Jared Leto.
378001	His performance was described by one critic as "silly, cliched and straight to video."
378002	Gyllenhaal had more success starring opposite Jennifer Aniston in The Good Girl, which premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival; he also starred in Lovely & Amazing with Catherine Keener.
378003	In both films he plays an unstable character who begins a reckless affair with an older woman.
378004	Gyllenhaal later described these as "teenager in transition" roles.
378005	Gyllenhaal later starred in the Touchstone Pictures romantic comedy Bubble Boy, which was loosely based on the story of David Vetter.
378006	The film portrays the title character's adventures as he pursues the love of his life before she marries the wrong man.
378007	The film was panned by critics, with one calling it an "empty-headed, chaotic, utterly tasteless atrocity". Following Bubble Boy, Gyllenhaal starred opposite Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Ellen Pompeo in Moonlight Mile, as a young man coping with the death of his fiancée and the grief of her parents.
378008	The story, which received mixed reviews, is loosely based on writer/director Brad Silberling's personal experiences following the murder of girlfriend Rebecca Schaeffer.
378009	Gyllenhaal was almost cast as Spider-Man for Spider-Man 2 due to director Sam Raimi's concerns about original Spider-Man star Tobey Maguire's health.
378010	Maguire recovered, however, and the sequel was shot without Gyllenhaal.
378011	Instead, Gyllenhaal starred in the blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow in 2004, co-starring Dennis Quaid as his father.
378012	In his theatrical debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London stage in Kenneth Lonergan's revival of This is Our Youth.
378013	Gyllenhaal said, "Every actor I look up to has done theatre work, so I knew I had to give it a try."
378014	The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London's West End.
378015	Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category "Outstanding Newcomer."
379000	2005 was a prolific year for Gyllenhaal, who starred in the critically praised films Proof, Jarhead, and Brokeback Mountain.
379001	In Proof, featuring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins, Gyllenhaal played a graduate student in mathematics who tries to convince Paltrow's character to publish a revolutionary proof to a problem puzzling the mathematicians' community.
379002	In Jarhead, Gyllenhaal played against his usual "sensitive yet disturbed" type by displaying an aggressive masculinity as a violent U.S. Marine during the first Gulf War.
379003	He also auditioned to be Batman for one of the biggest blockbusters Batman Begins and came close to getting the role but Christian Bale was ultimately chosen for it.
379004	In Brokeback Mountain, Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play young men who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual relationship that begins in the summer of 1963 and lasts for 20 years.
379005	The film was often referred to in the media with the shorthand phrase "the gay cowboy movie," though there was differing opinion on the sexual orientation of the characters.
379006	The film won the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival.
379007	The film went on to win four Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards, and three Academy Awards.
379008	Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance, but lost to George Clooney for Syriana.
379009	Gyllenhaal also won the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA for the same role and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and Best Film Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild.
379010	Also for Brokeback Mountain, he and Ledger won an MTV Movie Award for "Best Kiss" in 2006.
379011	Shortly after the 2006 Academy Awards, Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy in recognition of his acting career.
379012	Gyllenhaal was awarded the 2006 Young Artist Award for Artistic Excellence by The Americans for the Arts National Arts Awards for his role.
380000	Gyllenhaal expressed mixed feelings about the experience of being directed by Ang Lee in Brokeback Mountain, but generally had more praise than criticism for Lee's directing style.
380001	While complaining of the way Lee tended to disconnect from his actors once filming began, Gyllenhaal praised his encouraging direction of the actors and sensitive approach to the material.
380002	At the Directors Guild of America Awards on January 28, 2006, Gyllenhaal also praised Lee for "his humbleness and his respect for everyone around him."
380003	When asked about his kissing scenes with Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, Gyllenhaal said, "As an actor, I think we need to embrace the times we feel most uncomfortable."
380004	When asked about the more intimate scenes with Ledger, Gyllenhaal likened them to "doing a sex scene with a woman I'm not particularly attracted to."
380005	Following the release of Brokeback Mountain, rumors circulated regarding the actor's sexual orientation.
380006	When asked about such gossip during an interview, Gyllenhaal said: You know it's flattering when there's a rumor that says I'm bisexual. It means I can play more kinds of roles. I'm open to whatever people want to call me. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't think I would be afraid of it if it happened.
380007	Gyllenhaal narrated the 2005 short animated film The Man Who Walked Between the Towers, based on Mordicai Gerstein's book of the same name about Philippe Petit's famous stunt.
380008	In January 2007, as host of Saturday Night Live, he put on a sparkly evening dress and sang "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" from the musical Dreamgirls for his opening monologue, dedicating the song to his "unique fan base... the fans of Brokeback."
380009	In 2007, Gyllenhaal starred in David Fincher's Zodiac, which was based on a true story.
380010	He played Robert Graysmith, a San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist and author of two books about the Zodiac serial killer.
380011	Gyllenhaal starred opposite Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, and Reese Witherspoon in the October 2007 release Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the U.S. policy of extraordinary rendition.
380012	In 2009, he appeared with Tobey Maguire in Jim Sheridan's remake of Susanne Bier's 2004 Danish language film Brothers.
380013	In 2008, it was announced that Gyllenhaal would star in the comedy Nailed, which he filmed in South Carolina with Jessica Biel, as well as Doug Liman's as yet untitled film about the race for lunar colonization.
380014	The following year, Gyllenhaal played the lead role in the movie adaptation of the video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and released by Disney on May 28, 2010 and in the romantic comedy Love and Other Drugs, released on November 24, 2010, for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination.
381000	In 2012, Gyllenhaal starred alongside Michael Peña in David Ayer's film End of Watch about two Los Angeles street cops.
381001	The film was released on September 21, 2012 and received positive reviews, with Roger Ebert saying that "End of Watch is one of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action " and Salon.com's Andrew O'Hehir stating that the film was " at least the best cop movie since James Gray's We Own the Night," and very likely since Antoine Fuqua's memorable " Training Day (which, not coincidentally, was written by Ayer)". To train for the role, Gyllenhaal took tactical training and participated in actual police drives with co-star Michael Peña to help establish the language of the Salon characters The son of director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner, Gyllenhaal's immediate family includes his sister, actress Maggie, who is married to actor Peter Sarsgaard, Gyllenhaal's co-star in Jarhead and Rendition.
381002	In December 2006, Jake and his sister escaped a fire that destroyed Manka's, a famed lodge and restaurant in Inverness, California, at which they were vacationing.
381003	Gyllenhaal's niece, Ramona Sarsgaard, was born on October 3, 2006.
381004	Jamie Lee Curtis is Gyllenhaal's godmother, and he has repeatedly referred to his godfathers being a gay couple.
381005	Gyllenhaal himself is the godfather of Matilda Rose Ledger (born October 28, 2005), daughter of Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, both of whom co-starred with him in Brokeback Mountain.
381006	Gyllenhaal dated actress Kirsten Dunst for nearly two years, starting in 2002.
381007	He later dated his Rendition co-star Reese Witherspoon from about 2007 to 2009.
381008	He dated singer-songwriter Taylor Swift from October 2010 until January 2011.
381009	Gyllenhaal is politically active.
381010	He shot a commercial for Rock the Vote, and along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California to encourage students to vote during the 2004 U.S. Election.
381011	He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry.
381012	He has said, however, that "it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political. I try and say things with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power."
381013	In an interview for Rendition, he remarked that "it's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors."
382000	Raised in a family concerned with social issues, in 2003 Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization his entire family strongly supports.
382001	Environmentally conscious, he recycles regularly, and said in an interview that he spends $400 a year to have trees planted in a Mozambique forest, partly to promote the Future Forests program.
382002	After filming The Day After Tomorrow, he flew to the Arctic to promote awareness of climate change.
382003	In his spare time, Gyllenhaal enjoys woodworking and cooking.
382004	He has said, "I am not a card-carrying Buddhist, but I do try to practice mindfulness" and it is his goal to meditate every day.
382005	Gyllenhaal has signed on to help the TV fundraiser Stand Up To Cancer.
382006	On December 19, 2011, he was announced as a jury member for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival that was held in February 2012.
382007	Gyllenhaal was named one of People magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People" in 2006.
382008	He was also listed in People's "Hottest Bachelors of 2006". In response to mainstream press lists like these, thousands of gay and bisexual men were polled for the 2007 and 2008 "AfterElton.com Hot 100 List". Gyllenhaal was ranked at No.1 in both consecutive years.
382009	He was ranked at No.2 on the Gay Wired Magazine poll of male actors who have played gay characters in movies.
449000	Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings, CM (July 29, 1938 - August 7, 2005) was a Canadian American journalist and news anchor.
449001	He was the sole anchor of ABC's World News Tonight from 1983 until his death in 2005 of complications from lung cancer.
449002	A high-school dropout, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.
449003	Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at the age of nine.
449004	He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting a teen dance show, Saturday Date, on Saturdays.
449005	In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program.
449006	His inexperience was attacked by critics and others in television news, making for a difficult first stint in the anchor chair.
449007	Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East.
449008	He returned as one of World News Tonight's three anchors in 1978, and was promoted to the role of sole anchor in 1983.
449009	Jennings was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 or more hours straight to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, the Millennium celebrations in 2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001.
449010	In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates.
449011	Having always been fascinated with the United States, Jennings became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003.
449012	Along with Tom Brokaw at NBC and Dan Rather at CBS, Jennings formed part of the "Big Three" news anchors who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw and Rather.
450000	Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah were children of Elizabeth (Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids.
450001	His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.
450002	When Jennings was 11, he started attending Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, where he excelled in sports.
450003	After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute.
450004	He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of "pure boredom" that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. "
450005	I loved girls," he said. "I loved comic books. And for reasons I don't understand, I was pretty lazy."
450006	Jennings then briefly attended Carleton University, where he says he "lasted about 10 minutes" before dropping out.
450007	He also attended the University of Ottawa.
450008	Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada.
450009	He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him in the small town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch.
450010	During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific.
450011	It was in Brockville that the 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting.
450012	In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories, including his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC.
450013	By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa.
450014	When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program.
450015	His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.
451000	The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast.
451001	While reporting for CTV, he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
451002	In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
451003	There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. "
451004	The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada," Jennings later recalled. "I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?"
451005	Three months later though, he changed his mind and packed his bags for America.
451006	Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau.
451007	At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers.
451008	On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast.
451009	He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian.
451010	At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. "
451011	ABC was in bad shape at the time," Jennings said. "They were willing to try anything, and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me."
451012	An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he - and the upstart ABC News - could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC.
451013	Some in the American audience disliked Jennings' Canadian accent.
451014	He pronounced lieutenant as "leftenant", mangled the pronunciation of "Appomattox," and misidentified the "Marines' Hymn" as "Anchors Aweigh" at Lyndon Johnson's presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a "glamorcaster". "It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," he later reflected. "A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified."
451015	After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent.
452000	Jennings was determined to build his journalism credentials abroad.
452001	In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world.
452002	The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program.
452003	As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s.
452004	He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
452005	While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.
452006	In 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September.
452007	His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group.
452008	By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers.
452009	He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms "guerillas" and "commandos" instead of "terrorists" to describe the members of Black September.
452010	After the events of Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues.
452011	In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards.
452012	The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent.
452013	That summer, Jennings married for the second time, to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer.
452014	His first wife had been childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.
453000	Jennings returned to the U.S. at the end of 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America.
453001	ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today.
453002	AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington.
453003	The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months.
453004	In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad once again, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent.
453005	He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.
453006	Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, Roone Arledge, were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, which was then known as ABC Evening News and whose ratings had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception.
453007	In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas.
453008	Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program.
453009	On July 10, 1978, World News Tonight debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London.
453010	Jennings' official title was "Foreign Desk Anchor," although he continued to serve as the network's chief foreign correspondent.
453011	By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge's previous television coup, Wide World of Sports, had climbed in the ratings.
453012	The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC's evening newscast.
453013	Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life.
453014	In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton.
453015	That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth.
453016	In 1982, Jennings' and Marton's second child, Christopher, was born.
454000	As part of ABC's triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues.
454001	His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London gave the impression that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks.
454002	Jennings reported on the Iranian Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis, the assassination of Sadat, the Falklands war, Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and Pope John Paul II's 1983 visit to Poland.
454003	His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as "Jennings' Flying Circus."
454004	Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London.
454005	When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, The Journal.
454006	The CBC could not meet Jennings' renegotiation deadlines, though, and the deal fell through.
454007	In 1983, Reynolds fell ill with multiple myeloma, a type of leukemia/lymphoma that often attacks the bones, and was forced to stop anchoring in April.
454008	His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast.
454009	ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, although it remained in third place.
454010	On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.
454011	On August 9, 1983, ABC announced that Jennings had signed a four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5.
454012	Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations.
454013	The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the "Big Three" era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC.
454014	Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings.
454015	At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. "
454016	With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," he said. "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake."
455000	Jennings' debut on September 5, 1983, marked the beginning of a steady climb in the ratings for ABC News.[
455001	a] He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the 1984 presidential campaign season.[
455002	b] In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. "
455003	I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years," Jennings said, "so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right."
455004	Jennings and ABC were criticized for suddenly halting coverage of the convention for 30 minutes and airing a rerun of Hart to Hart instead.
455005	Despite a shaky start at the anchor desk, Jennings' broadcast began to climb in the ratings.
455006	Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours.
455007	By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch.
455008	When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News.
455009	The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
455010	It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.
455011	Jennings' on-air success continued in 1990, and World News Tonight consistently led the ratings race.
455012	In January, he anchored the first installment of Peter Jennings Reporting-hour-long, prime-time ABC News specials dedicated to exploring a single topic.
455013	His inaugural program on gun violence in America drew praise.
455014	His second installment of Peter Jennings Reporting in April, "From the Killing Fields", focused on U.S. policy towards Cambodia.
455015	The program alleged that the federal government was covertly supporting the Khmer Rouge's return to power in the Asian nation, a charge that the Bush administration initially denied.
455016	On July 18, though, the White House announced that it was ending recognition of the Khmer Rouge.
456000	When the Gulf War started on January 16, 1991, Jennings began a marathon anchoring stint to cover the story, spending 20 of the first 48 hours of the war on-air, and leading ABC News to its highest-ever ratings.[
456001	c] After interrupting regular Saturday morning cartoons on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing from Saudi Arabia, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the emotional impact of the war coverage on children.
456002	Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.
456003	On October 13, 1991, breaking news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again.
456004	Jennings was once again mindful of his audience, prefacing the coverage of the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. "
456005	You may hear some not very nice language," said Jennings.
456006	He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more."
456007	Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.
456008	Politics dominated network news in 1992.
456009	Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June.
456010	On September 9, 1992, ABC announced that it would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. "
456011	We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put at least some of the blame on us," Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television."
456012	After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.
457000	The early 1990s also served up a series of difficult experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings.
457001	On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday.
457002	The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton was having an affair with Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen.
457003	In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on World News Tonight, Emily Rooney.
457004	The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.
457005	With the rise of media watchdog groups, such as the conservative Media Research Center (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias.
457006	The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and Cal Thomas, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on ABC Radio, in which he analyzed the results of the 1994 U.S. midterm elections. "
457007	Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," said Jennings. "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old."
457008	A July 1995 documentary, Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped, which aired a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, also drew scorn from conservatives and some television critics, who called the program a revisionist look at the decision to drop the bomb.
457009	Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.
457010	Jennings pleased some conservatives though, after his three-year lobbying effort to create a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter.
457011	ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches.
457012	At a taping of a "town meeting" segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. "
457013	People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I should go back to Canada," he said. "I hope I don't make that mistake again."
458000	During the mid-1990s, television critics praised Jennings for his insistence on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast.[
458001	d] Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials on the subject and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children.
458002	ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996.
458003	Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story.
458004	Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum.
458005	The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, and he was the only anchor to broadcast from Canada on the eve of the referendum.
458006	Despite these critical successes, in 1996, World News Tonight started gradually slipping in the ratings race.
458007	Bolstered by strong viewership of its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, NBC's Nightly News overtook the ABC newscast for two weeks in late July and early September.
458008	This short bump provided momentum for NBC, which started making steady gains in the ratings.
458009	Worried, Jennings and ABC decided to cut back on international reporting and give more air time to "soft stories", in an effort to emulate the success of Nightly News.
458010	The changes provoked a backlash from regular viewers, and ratings plummeted. "
458011	We did very badly with it," Jennings said. "The audience kicked us in the teeth."
458012	Although changes were made to World News Tonight to restore its luster and stop the hemorrhaging, Nightly News ended 1997 as the number-one evening newscast.
458013	The slide in the ratings coincided with some rockiness at ABC News.
458014	The company scrapped plans to develop a cable news channel.
458015	On May 29, 1998, David Westin succeeded Roone Arledge as president of ABC News.
458016	Both denied that the disappointing ratings performance of World News Tonight contributed to the decision.
458017	A 24-hour strike by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians disrupted ABC's coverage of 1998's November elections after talks between the union and ABC broke down.
458018	Several Democratic candidates denied interviews to support the union.
459000	None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake the nightly ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered stiff competition at second place.
459001	As the millennium approached, Jennings and the network started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century.
459002	The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America.
459003	Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped the New York Times Best Seller List in December 1998, a month after it debuted.
459004	On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on the monumental project started in 1990, and by the time it aired, it had cost the network $25 million.[
459005	e] Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, The Century: America's Time, on the History Channel in April 1999.
459006	On December 31, 1999, Jennings was on the air for 23 straight hours to anchor ABC 2000 Today, ABC's massive millennium eve special.
459007	An estimated 175 million people tuned in to at least a portion of the program.
459008	Jennings' American prime-time audience, an estimated 18.6 million viewers, easily outpaced the millennium coverage of rival networks.
459009	Television critics praised the program, and described the anchor as "superhuman". Although production costs totaled a hefty $11 million (compared with $2 million each for NBC's and CBS's millennium projects), ABC managed to make a profit of $5 million.
459010	The success of the program, though, failed to transfer into any lasting change in the viewership of World News Tonight; ABC's evening newscast spent the first week of January as ratings leader, before dropping back to second place.
459011	With another presidential election taking place in 2000, Jennings had some more political reporting duties that year.
459012	On January 5, Jennings moderated the Democratic primary debate, held at the University of New Hampshire.
459013	He hosted the primetime news special The Dark Horizon: India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, which ABC broadcast on March 22, as then-President Clinton began his trip to the region.
459014	Jennings was the only American news anchor to travel to India for Clinton's trip.
459015	Paul A. Slavin became the new executive producer for World News Tonight in April.
460000	Jennings anchored ABC's coverage of the September 11 attacks for seventeen straight hours, an effort described as "Herculean" by television critics.
460001	Like other network news anchors, he was widely praised for guiding Americans through the tragedy.
460002	At one point, Jennings broke his composure after receiving phone calls from his children. "
460003	We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair," he said, "but...if you're a parent, you've got a kid in some other part of the country, call them up. Exchange observations."
460004	His coverage was not without controversy though. After conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh criticized Jennings for supposedly denigrating President George W. Bush on-air during September 11, ABC was flooded with more than 10,000 angry phone calls and e-mails.
460005	Jennings, however, never made the remarks, and Limbaugh later apologized and made a retraction.
460006	On September 13, Jennings received more criticism from conservatives - this time for hosting a forum for Middle East experts that included his former girlfriend, Hanan Ashrawi.
460007	In the summer of 2002, Jennings and ABC refused to allow Toby Keith to open their coverage of July 4 celebrations with "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue", prompting criticism from Keith and country music fans, who highlighted the anchor's Canadian citizenship.
460008	The events of September 11 added new meaning to In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after the success of their previous collaboration.
460009	The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them.
460010	To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year.
460011	Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book.
460012	Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.
461000	Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks contributed to his decision in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. "
461001	I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," he said. "And when we were working on the America project I spent a lot of time on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future."
461002	His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. "
461003	Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" he asked. "It would have been horrendous."
461004	The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan.
461005	The occasion overwhelmed him. "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit - my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit - but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway."
461006	As he did in 2000, Jennings moderated the 2004 Democratic presidential primary debate, which was held that year at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire.
461007	He was noted for questioning General Wesley Clark over Clark's silence over controversial comments made by filmmaker Michael Moore, a supporter of Clark.
461008	Moore called then - President George W. Bush a "deserter". By late 2004, Brokaw had retired from his anchoring duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned to step down in March 2005.
461009	Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience.
461010	However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region.
461011	For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.
462000	In late March, viewers started noticing that Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and unhealthy during evening newscasts.
462001	On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight for the last time; his poor health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II.
462002	On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. "
462003	As some of you now know, I have learned in the last couple of days that I have lung cancer," he said. "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit."
462004	Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.
462005	Throughout the summer, Charles Gibson, co-host of Good Morning America, and Elizabeth Vargas, co-host of 20/20, served as temporary anchors.
462006	On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com with an update of his status and expressing thanks to those who had offered him their good wishes and prayers.
462007	In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional speech; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, "for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News."
462008	He posted another short letter of thanks on July 29, 2005, his 67th birthday.
462009	However during his visit, his colleagues have noticed he was getting gravely ill to the point where he could barely make his emotional speech.
462010	On August 7, 2005, just after 11:30 pm EDT, Charles Gibson broke into local news in the Eastern U.S. and regular programming on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from lung cancer.
462011	He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his wife, two children, and sister at his side.
462012	The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel. shared their thoughts on Jennings's death.
462013	The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. "
462014	Peter, of the three of us, was our prince," said Brokaw on Today. "He seemed so timeless. He had such élan and style."
462015	Canada's television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings' death and had remembrances from their "big three" anchors, Peter Mansbridge at the CBC, Lloyd Robertson at CTV, and Kevin Newman at Global.
463000	American President George W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin offered statements of condolence to the press.
463001	On August 10, 2005, ABC aired a two-hour special, Peter Jennings: Reporter, with archival clips of his reports and interviews with colleagues and friends.
463002	The special drew over 9 million viewers, and was the most watched television program of the night.
463003	For the week of his death, World News Tonight placed number one in the ratings race for the first time since June 2004.
463004	Jennings's widow, Kayce Freed, and family held a private service in New York.
463005	Jennings was cremated and his ashes split in half.
463006	Half of his ashes remained in his home in Long Island and the other half was placed in his summer home in the Gatineau Hills, near Ottawa.
463007	The 57th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 18, 2005, included a tribute to Jennings by Brokaw and Rather.
463008	A public memorial service for Jennings was held two days later at Carnegie Hall.
463009	Notable journalists, political leaders, and other friends of Jennings attended.
463010	Jennings left a $50m estate, half went to Freed; most of the rest to his son and daughter.
463011	On December 5, 2005, after much speculation, and nearly eight months after Jennings stopped anchoring, ABC named Vargas and Bob Woodruff co-anchors for World News Tonight.
466000	Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional basketball player who played point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA Draft by the Lakers.
466001	He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s.
466002	Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award.
466003	After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.
466004	Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations.
466005	He led the league in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2.
466006	Johnson was a member of the "Dream Team", the U.S. basketball team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1992.
466007	After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that travelled around the world playing exhibition games.
466008	Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.
466009	He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007.
466010	His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, were well documented.
466011	Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster and motivational speaker.
466012	Johnson was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years, and was part of a group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012.
467000	Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan to Earvin Sr., a General Motors assembly worker, and Christine, a schoolcustodian.
467001	Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a youngster, idolizing players such as Earl Monroeand Marques Haynes, and practicing "all day".
467002	Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Lansing's Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds and 16 assists.
467003	After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious.
467004	In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27-1 win-loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game.
467005	Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home.
467006	His college decision came down to the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in East Lansing.
467007	He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when its coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position.
467008	The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.
467009	Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major and on his desire to become a television commentator.
467010	Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25-5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament.
467011	The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.
467012	During the 1978-79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State University, which was led by senior Larry Bird.
467013	In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75-64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four.
467014	After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.9 assists per game, Johnson was drafted in the 1979 NBA Draft.
467015	After the 1994-95 season, Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans, and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the Breslin Center to play in the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game.
467016	He led all scorers with 39 points.
468000	Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers.
468001	Johnson said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history.
468002	Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal.
468003	Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.
468004	The Lakers compiled a 60-22 record in the regular season and reached the 1980 NBA Finals, in which they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by forward Julius Erving.
468005	The Lakers took a 3-2 lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33 points a game in the series, sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6.
468006	Paul Westhead decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals in a 123-107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game.
468007	Johnson became the only rookie to win the NBA Finals MVP award, and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history.
468008	He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years.
468009	Early in the 1980-81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn cartilage in his left knee.
468010	He missed 45 games, and said that his rehabilitation was the "most down" he had ever felt.
468011	Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a "divided team". The 54-win Lakers faced the 40-42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2-1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3.
469000	In 1981, after the 1980-81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $ 25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point.
469001	Early in the 1981-82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" and "predictable". After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley.
469002	Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Lakers' fans.
469003	However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead-Johnson altercation, but assistant GMJerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision.
469004	Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team.
469005	He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season.
469006	The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals.
469007	After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4-2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award.
469008	During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2 points on.533 shooting, 10.8 rebounds, 8.0 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.
469009	Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley.
469010	During the 1982-83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 16.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 8.6 rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination.
469011	The Lakers again reached the Finals, and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone as well as Erving.

471010	After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108-105 win.

472002	Playing without Abdul - Jabbar for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award after a strong 1989-90 NBA season in which he averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 assists, and 6.6 rebounds per game.

472004	Johnson performed well during the 1990-91 NBA season, with averages of 19.4 points, 12.5 assists, and 7.0 rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the 1991 NBA Finals.
472005	There they faced the Chicago Bulls, led by shooting guard Michael Jordan, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his era.
472006	Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson and Jordan, Bulls forward Scottie Pippen defended effectively against Johnson.
472007	Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, finals MVP Jordan led his team to a 4-1 win.
472008	In the last championship series of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6 points on .431 shooting, 12.4 assists, and 8.0 rebounds per triple game After a physical before the 1991-92 NBA season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV.
472009	In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately.
472010	He stated that his wife Cookie and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to "battle this deadly disease". Johnson initially said that he did not know how he contracted the disease, but later acknowledged that it was through having multiple sexual partners during his playing career.
472011	At the time, only a small percentage of HIV-positive American men had contracted it from heterosexual sex, and it was initially rumored that Johnson wasgay or bisexual, although he denied both.
472012	Johnson later accused Isiah Thomas of spreading the rumors, a claim Thomas denied.
472013	Johnson's HIV announcement became a major news story in the United States, and in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh most memorable moment of the past 25 years.
472014	Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush said, "For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports."
473000	Despite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as a starter for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game at Orlando Arena, although his former teammates Byron Scott and A. C. Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court.
473001	Johnson led the West to a 153-113 win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds.
473002	The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.
473003	Johnson was chosen to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics for the US basketball team, dubbed the "Dream Team" because of the NBA stars on the roster.
473004	During the tournament, which the USA won, Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received standing ovations from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.
473005	Before the 1992-93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback.
473006	After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players.
473007	During his retirement, Johnson has written a book on safer sex, run several businesses, worked for NBC as a commentator, and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team of former college and NBA players.
473008	In 1985, Johnson created "A Midsummer Night's Magic", a yearly charity event which included an celebrity basketball game and a black tie dinner.
473009	The proceeds went to the United Negro College Fund, and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005. "
473010	A Midsummer Night's Magic" eventually came under the umbrella of the Magic Johnson Foundation, which he founded in 1991.
473011	The 1992 event, which was the first one held after Johnson's appearance in the 1992 Olympics, raised over $1.3 million for UNCF.
473012	Magic Johnson joined Shaquille O'Neal and celebrity coach Spike Lee to lead the blue team to a 147-132 victory over the white team, which was coached by Arsenio Hall.
474000	Johnson returned to the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the 1993-94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games.
474001	Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted "I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back of my mind."
474002	He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, "I'm retired. Let's leave it at that."
474003	Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, Johnson took over a team that had a 28-38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.
474004	He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, who would retire after the season, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant.
474005	Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the1994-95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation.
474006	The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season.
474007	The Lakers finished the season on a ten game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5-11.
474008	Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.
474009	At the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback as a player when he re-joined the Lakers during the 1995-96 NBA season.
474010	During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds.
474011	He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the Golden State Warriors.
474012	Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128-118 victory.
474013	On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the Atlanta Hawks.
474014	Playing power forward, he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award.
474015	The Lakers had a record of 22-10 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback "a success."
474016	While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court.
474017	Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Magic Johnson's arrival, left the team for several days.
474018	He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain.
474019	Nick Van Exel received a seven game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9.
474020	Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were "inexcusable."
474021	Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games.
474022	He also missed several games due to a calf injury.
474023	Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53-29 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs.
474024	Although they were facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series.

474026	Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets won three games to one.
475000	After the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, Johnson initially expressed a desire to return to the team for the 1996-97 NBA season, but he also talked about joining another team as a free agent, hoping to see more playing time at point guard instead of power forward.
475001	A few days later Johnson changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, "I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992."
475002	Determined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players.
475003	In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Reggie Theus, John Long, Earl Cureton, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan.
475004	They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the CBA.

475010	Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points.
475011	Johnson's half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short.
475012	On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State.
475013	Playing with the Canberra Cannons of Australia's National Basketball League instead of his usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104-85, as he scored 12 points, with 10 assists and 10 rebounds.

476002	In 1991, Johnson married Earlitha "Cookie" Kelly in a small wedding in Lansing which included guests Thomas, Aguirre, and Herb Williams.

476007	The game was played at a gym inside Fort McNair, and reporters covering the President were not allowed to enter.
476008	The basketball game was part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.

477006	In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, a committee appointed by members of Congress and the Bush Administration.
477007	Johnson left after eight months, saying that the White House had "utterly ignored" the work of the panel, and had opposed the commission's recommendations, which included universal healthcare and the expansion of Medicaid to cover all low-income people with AIDS.
477008	He was also the main speaker for the United Nations (UN) World AIDS Day Conference in 1999,and has served as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.
477009	HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals, but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups.
477010	Johnson stated that his aim was to "help educate all people about what [HIV] is about" and teach others not to "discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS". Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.
477011	To prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a daily combination of drugs.
477012	He has advertised GlaxoSmithKline's drugs, and partnered with Abbott Laboratories to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.

He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127). Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "Showtime", described as a mix of "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams."
478002	Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, "There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody."
478003	Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players.
478004	He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only toOscar Robertson's 181.
478005	For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.
478006	ESPN's SportsCentury ranked Johnson #17 in their "50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century"In 2006, ESPN.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time, stating, "It could be argued that he's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan."
478007	Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA.
479000	Johnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals.
479001	The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987.
479002	Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers-Celtics games.
479003	Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.
479004	Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson-Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites.
479005	The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA.
479006	Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.
479007	With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair.
479008	Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.
479009	Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.
479010	Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a "friend forever"; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.
485000	Eric Bana (born 9 August 1968) is an Australian film and television actor.
485001	He began his career as a comedian in the sketch comedy series Full Frontal before gaining critical recognition in the biopic Chopper (2000). After a decade of roles in Australian TV shows and films, Bana gained Hollywood's attention by playing the role of American Delta Force Sergeant Norm "Hoot" Hooten in Black Hawk Down (2001), the lead role as Bruce Banner from Marvel Comics, in the Ang Lee directed film Hulk (2003), Hector in the movie Troy (2004), the lead in Steven Spielberg's Munich (2005), and the villain Nero in the science-fiction film Star Trek (2009).  An accomplished dramatic actor and comedian, he received Australia's highest film and television awards for his performances in Chopper, Full Frontal and Romulus, My Father.
485002	Bana has performed across a wide spectrum of leading roles in a variety of low-budget and major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction and action thrillers.
485003	Eric Bana was born Eric Banadinović in Melbourne, Victoria, the younger of two children; he has a brother, Anthony.
485004	He is of Croatian ancestry on his father's side.
485005	Bana's paternal grandfather, Mate Banadinović, moved to Argentina after the Second World War, and Bana's paternal grandmother emigrated to Germany and then to Australia in the 1950s with her son, Ivan (Bana's father). Bana's father was a logistics manager for Caterpillar, Inc.,
485006	and Bana's German-born mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser.
485007	Bana grew up in Melbourne's Tullamarine, a suburban area on the northern edge of the city, near the main airport.
485008	In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. "
485009	Wog is such a terrible word," he said.
485010	He has stated: "I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin".
486000	Showing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms.
486001	In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble.
486002	As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor.
486003	However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand-up comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel.
486004	His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.
486005	In 1993, Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard's late night talk show, Tonight Live.
486006	His performance gained the attention of producers from the sketch comedy series, Full Frontal, who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer.
486007	During his four years on the show, Bana wrote much of his own material, and based some of his characters on members of his family.
486008	His impressions of Columbo, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Tom Cruise made Bana popular with the show's audience.
486009	This success led him to record the comedy album Out of Bounds in 1994 and to host his own television special, titled Eric, in 1996.
486010	The show, a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters, prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series The Eric Bana Show.
486011	The series, written and performed by Bana, featured skits, stand-up and celebrity guests, but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings.
486012	Even so, in 1997, he received a Logie Award for "Most Popular Comedy Personality" for his work on the show.
487000	That same year, Bana made his film debut in the Australian film The Castle, which tells the story of a Melbourne-based family's struggles to keep their home by Melbourne's airport as the airport authority force them to move.
487001	He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous, a kickboxing accountant who is the householder's son-in-law.
487002	The Castle was a surprise critical and financial success, earning A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia.
487003	In 1997, in spite of his lack of experience in dramatic roles, Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik to appear in the film Chopper (2000), a biopic based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read.
487004	Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read.
487005	Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.
487006	For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained thirty pounds, and spent two days with Read to perfect his mimicry.
487007	During filming he arrived on set at four in the morning and spent five hours being covered in Read's trademark tattoos.
487008	In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews.
487009	American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001.
487010	Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.
487011	In 2001, director Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American soldier in the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition.
487012	In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Gibson, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights his way out of a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry.
487013	Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began.
487014	He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.
488000	Bana's next project was the low-budget Australian film The Nugget (2002). A comedy, the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working class men and was released with moderate success in Australia.
488001	Bana read the script after filming Chopper in 2000 and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood and because he found its characters amusing and likeable.
488002	While filming The Nugget, Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular comic book series The Incredible Hulk.
488003	Only after learning of director Ang Lee's involvement in the project did he consider the role.
488004	Bana admired Lee for his work on the film The Ice Storm and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete.
488005	He said he was drawn to the film because "the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential" and was "a fairly non-traditional superhero". Hulk (2003) received mixed reviews and a moderate success at the box office, but Bana's performance was praised: Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner "with great conviction". Bana earned an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for "Cinescape Genre Face of the Future" for the film.
488006	In 2004, Bana co-starred with Brad Pitt in the big-budget film Troy.
488007	In the film, he played Prince Hector, leader of the Trojan forces battling against the Greek warrior Achilles.
488008	Director Wolfgang Petersen offered him a role in the film after meeting with Brad Pitt, a fan of Chopper.
488009	The film was an international success, grossing US$364million.
488010	In North America however, it earned considerably less, grossing less than US$133million.
488011	After the critical disappointment of Hulk and Troy, critics questioned Bana's bankability in big-budget films.
488012	He responded in Empire Magazine: "It's not like it [Hulk] was a flop. When you're on a long shoot it is a long personal investment. If I wasn't happy with the end result I'd be bloody upset, but in every case so far I've been happy. Troy could take $50 and I wouldn't regret it."
489000	The following year, Bana co-starred with Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush in Steven Spielberg's controversial film Munich.
489001	Bana played Avner, a Mossad agent, who is ordered to track down and kill the Black September terrorists thought to be responsible for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics.
489002	The film was a critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards in 2006.
489003	The Los Angeles Times wrote that Bana as Avner "projects a combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness and ... knows how to present a face for which worry is a new experience."
489004	Bana was considered for play James Bond role in 2006 film Casino Royale but he lost out to Daniel Craig.
489005	In 2006, Bana was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
489006	Lucky You, a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming Munich, was released in early 2007.
489007	In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional poker player who must overcome his personal problems to win a high stakes tournament in Las Vegas.
489008	His next film was the Australian drama Romulus, My Father (2007). The film, based on Raimond Gaita's memoir of the same name, portrays a couple and their struggle in the face of adversity to raise their son.
489009	The film was a critical success, and Bana's performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.
489010	In 2007, he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy Kath and Kim as himself.
489011	Bana's next project was the historical drama The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). In the film he played Henry VIII of England opposite Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman.
489012	Bana was surprised to be offered the role and admitted that he "probably would have just passed it on without even opening it" if it had been presented to him under a different title.
489013	The following year, he co-starred with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in the science fiction film Star Trek.
489014	In the film, Bana played Nero, a Romulan mining ship captain who attempts to exact revenge on Spock, whom he blames for the destruction of his homeworld and its inhabitants.
489015	The film was a critical success and grossed over US$380million worldwide.
490000	In August 2009, he appeared as Henry DeTamble in the film adaptation of The Time Traveler's Wife.
490001	Bana also co-starred with Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen in Judd Apatow's third directorial feature, about stand-up comics, titled Funny People, marking Bana's first appearance in an American mainstream comedy.
490002	In 2009, Bana released a self-produced and directed documentary-style film called Love the Beast.
490003	It details his personal relationship with his first car and follows his progression as a car lover.
490004	Along the way he seeks guidance and wisdom from the inner sanctum of his three lifelong friends, as well as celebrities Jay Leno, Jeremy Clarkson, and Dr. Phil.
490005	In 2011, Bana appeared as Erik Heller in the action thriller film Hanna, starring alongside Saoirse Ronan & Cate Blanchett.
490006	The film would become another success for Bana as the film opened at No. 2 in the US boxoffice.
490007	He is set to star in Elvis & Nixon as Elvis Presley.
490008	In 1995, while working on the television series Full Frontal, Bana began dating Rebecca Gleeson, a publicist with the Seven Network and daughter of then Chief Justice of New South Wales, and later Chief Justice of Australia, Murray Gleeson.
490009	They married in 1997, after Bana proposed to her on a trip to the United States, which he won from Cleo Magazine after being named their "Bachelor of the Year" in 1996.
490010	Bana and Gleeson have two children, a son, Klaus (born August 1999), and a daughter, Sophia (born April 2002). They live in Melbourne.
490011	On the official identity documents he still has his birth surname, Banadinović.
490012	Bana is a motor racing enthusiast, and participates in various motor racing competitions in Australia.
490013	At the age of fourteen, Bana wanted to leave school to focus full-time on becoming a motor mechanic, but his father convinced him to complete school, advising him to avoid making his hobby a job.
490014	Bana purchased his first car, a 1974 XB Ford Falcon coupé, at the age of fifteen for A$1100 and driving it, made his motor sport racing debut in 1996's Targa Tasmania, a week-long race around the island state of Tasmania. (
490015	Bana has had this car for more than a quarter century.
490016	In 2009 he released a documentary named Love The Beast.
490017	The film details the central role that racing and fixing this same car has played in his life and the lives of his friends.)
490018	In 2004, Bana purchased a Porsche 944 to compete in Australia's Porsche Challenge.
490019	Competing throughout 2004, he often finished in the top ten and in November, finished fourth at the Sandown 500, a personal best.
490020	On 21 April 2007 Bana crashed his 1974 XB Falcon Coupe in the Targa Tasmania rally.
490021	Neither he nor his co-driver were injured.
490022	Bana appeared on the British motoring show Top Gear on 15 November 2009 as a guest for its "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment.
490023	Bana completed a lap of the Top Gear test track in 1-minute and 47.5 seconds on a wet track, the fastest wet lap ever recorded at that time.
491000	Bana is a prominent fan of Australian rules football.
491001	His love of the sport began at a young age when his godfather took him to games to see the St Kilda Football Club, his favourite team in the Australian Football League.
491002	Bana can often be seen at AFL games when he is back in Australia.
491003	Bana's love for St Kilda FC resulted in the club being featured in the film Funny People and in Bana's promotion of the film in 2009, notably on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
491004	In 2010, Bana was named the "Saints Number One Ticket Holder". Bana is an ambassador for Father Chris Riley's charity for homeless young people, Youth off the Streets.
491005	In 2008 he appeared with Father Chris in an advertisement to support the organisation's annual appeal.
491006	Bana is also an advocate for the Mental Illness Fellowship, which works to increase the awareness of mental illness in Australia.
491007	In 2004, he appeared in several high profile advertisements for the fellowship.
491008	Bana is also active in campaigns with the Australian Childhood Foundation and the Bone Marrow Donor Institute.
491009	Since 1995, he has participated in the Motorcycle Riders Association Toy Run in Melbourne, which raises money and toys for needy children at Christmas.
491010	In 2005, Bana narrated the documentary Terrors of Tasmania about the endangered Tasmanian Devil.
491011	The film followed the life of a female Tasmanian Devil called Manganinnie and discussed the incurable facial cancer which threatens the survival of the species.
491012	He has also worked with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, donating money to animal shelters in Berlin while filming Troy in 2004.
492000	David Robert Jones (born 8 January 1947), known by his stage name David Bowie, is an English musician, actor, record producer and arranger.
492001	Bowie has been a major figure in the world of popular music for over four decades, and is renowned as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s.
492002	He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work.
492003	Bowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song "Space Oddity" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart.
492004	After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single "Starman" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
492005	Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, "challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day" and "created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture."
492006	The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.
492007	In 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single "Fame" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as "plastic soul". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.
492008	He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)-the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years.
492009	This so-called "Berlin Trilogy" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
492010	After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single "Ashes to Ashes", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and "Under Pressure", a 1981 collaboration with Queen.
492011	He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles.
492012	Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle.
492013	He has not toured since the 2003-04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006.
492014	Bowie's latest studio album The Next Day was released in March 2013.
493000	Buckley says of Bowie: "His influence has been unique in popular culture-he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."
493001	In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29.
493002	Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140 million albums.
493003	In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications.
493004	In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time.
493005	David Bowie was born David Robert Jones in Brixton, London, on 8 January 1947.
493006	His Irish mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns), worked as a cinema usherette, while his father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones, was a promotions officer for Barnardo's.
493007	The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, located near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and Stockwell.
493008	Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child-and a defiant brawler.
493009	In 1953 the family moved to the suburb of Bromley, where, two years later, Bowie progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School.
493010	His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and his recorder playing judged to demonstrate above-average musical ability.
493011	At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child.
493012	The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, The Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard.
493013	Upon listening to "Tutti Frutti", Bowie would later say, "I had heard God". Presley's impact on him was likewise emphatic: "I saw a cousin of mine dance to ... 'Hound Dog' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that."
493014	By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass and begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry-complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists-to his local Wolf Cub group was described as "mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet."
493015	Failing his eleven plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie joined Bromley Technical High School.
494000	It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford writes: Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] public school. There were houses, named after eighteenth-century statesmen like Pitt and Wilberforce. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton.
494001	In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, Peter, to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.
494002	Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting.
494003	After Terry Burns, his half-brother, introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a plastic alto saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician.
494004	Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.
494005	Doctors feared he would become blind in that eye.
494006	After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil.
494007	The latter condition has misled some to believe that Bowie has different coloured eyes, when in reality both irises are the same blue colour.[
494008	dead link] Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.
494009	Graduating from his plastic saxophone to a real instrument in 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15.
494010	Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.
494011	When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star.
494012	His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician's mate.
494013	Frustrated by his band-mates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees.
494014	He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to "do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles-and make another million."
494015	Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.
495000	Conn quickly began to promote Bowie.
495001	The singer's debut single, "Liza Jane", credited to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success.
495002	Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon blues numbers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul - "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger", Bowie was to recall. "
495003	I Pity the Fool" was no more successful than "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by The Who. "
495004	You've Got a Habit of Leaving" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract.
495005	Declaring that he would exit the pop world "to study mime at Sadler's Wells", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third.
495006	His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, "Do Anything You Say". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and Velvet Underground material, went unreleased.
495007	Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.
495008	Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Bowie renamed himself after the 19th century American frontiersman Jim Bowie and the knife he had popularised.
495009	His April 1967 solo single, "The Laughing Gnome", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart.
495010	Released six weeks later, his album debut, David Bowie, an amalgam of pop, psychedelia, and music hall, met the same fate.
495011	It was his last release for two years.
495012	Bowie's fascination with the bizarre was fuelled when he met dancer Lindsay Kemp: "He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."
495013	Kemp, for his part, recalled, "I didn't really teach him to be a mime artiste but to be more of himself on the outside, ... I enabled him to free the angel and demon that he is on the inside."
495014	Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world.
495015	Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year.
495016	After Kemp cast Bowie with Hermione Farthingale for a poetic minuet, the pair began dating; they soon moved into a London flat together.
495017	Playing acoustic guitar, she formed a group with Bowie and bassist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969, when Bowie and Farthingale broke up, the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.
496000	Because of his lack of commercial success, Bowie was forced to try to earn a living in different ways.
496001	He featured in a Lyons Maid ice cream commercial, but was rejected for another by Kit Kat.
496002	Love You till Tuesday, was a 30-minute film featuring performances from his repertoire and was intended as a vehicle to promote the singer.
496003	Although the film was not released until 1984, the filming sessions in January 1969 led to unexpected success when Bowie told the producers, "That film of yours-I've got a new song for it."
496004	He then demoed the song that provided his commercial breakthrough. "
496005	Space Oddity" was released on 11 July, five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch, to become a UK top five hit.
496006	Breaking up with Farthingale shortly after completion of the film, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.
496007	Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street.
496008	This soon morphed into the Beckenham Arts Lab, and became extremely popular.
496009	The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, later immortalised by Bowie in his song "Memory of a Free Festival". Bowie's second album, Space Oddity, followed in November; originally issued in the UK as David Bowie, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled Man of Words/Man of Music. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.
496010	Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969.
496011	They married within a year.
496012	Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating.
496013	Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for gigs and recording-people he could relate to personally". The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.
496014	A band was duly assembled.
496015	John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, was joined by Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar.
496016	Known as The Hype, the band members created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of The Spiders From Mars.
496017	After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist.
496018	Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style; matters came to a head when Bowie, enraged, accused, "You're fucking up my album."
496019	Cambridge summarily quit and was replaced by Mick Woodmansey.
496020	Not long after, in a move that resulted in years of litigation, at the conclusion of which Bowie was forced to pay Pitt compensation, the singer fired his manager, replacing him with Tony Defries.
497000	The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World (1970). Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band, it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by Space Oddity.
497001	To promote it in the United States, Mercury Records financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media.
497002	Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews - to the approval of critics, including Rolling Stone's John Mendelsohn who described him as "ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall" - and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to "kiss my ass". During the tour Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing "the ultimate pop idol". A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars". Hunky Dory (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles, by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder respectively.
497003	The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of "Space Oddity", with light fare such as "Kooks", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. (His parents chose "his kooky name"-he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years-after the Greek word zoe, life.)
497004	Elsewhere, the album explored more serious themes, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with "Song for Bob Dylan", "Andy Warhol", and "Queen Bitch", a Velvet Underground pastiche.
497005	It was not a significant commercial success at the time but was ranked number 58 by voters on the All Time Top 1000 Albums list.
498000	With his next venture, Bowie, in the words of biographer David Buckley, "challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day" and "created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture". Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed red, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars-Ronson, Bolder and Woodmansey-at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10 February 1972.
498001	The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the course of the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique-its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."
498002	The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June. "
498003	Starman", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song.
498004	The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory.
498005	At the same time the non-album single "John, I'm Only Dancing", and "All the Young Dudes", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, became UK hits.
498006	The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.
498007	Bowie contributed backing vocals to Lou Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer, co-producing the album with Mick Ronson.
498008	His own Aladdin Sane (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number one album.
498009	Described by Bowie as "Ziggy goes to America", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the United States during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album.
498010	Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles "The Jean Genie" and "Drive-In Saturday".
499000	Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "
499001	Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David."
499002	With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust-and, later, the Thin White Duke-from his own character offstage.
499003	Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."
499004	His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar.
499005	Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage "retirement" at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973.
499006	Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
499007	After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona.
499008	His back catalogue was now highly sought: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity. "
499009	Life on Mars?", from Hunky Dory, was released in June 1973 and made number three in the UK singles chart.
499010	Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, "The Laughing Gnome", reached number four.
499011	Pin Ups, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in "Sorrow" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK.
499012	It brought the total number of Bowie albums currently in the UK chart to six.
500000	Bowie moved to the United States in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles.
500001	Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music.
500002	The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "Rebel Rebel" and "Diamond Dogs", and number five in the US.
500003	To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974.
500004	Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob.
500005	The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems.
500006	He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only In Theory". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US.
500007	It also spawned a UK number ten hit in Bowie's cover of "Knock on Wood". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.
500008	The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."
500009	The album's sound, which the singer identified as "plastic soul", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.
500010	Young Americans yielded Bowie's first US number one, "Fame", co-written with John Lennon, who contributed backing vocals, and Carlos Alomar.
500011	Lennon called Bowie's work "great, but just rock and roll with lipstick on". Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show Soul Train, Bowie mimed "Fame", as well as "Golden Years", his November single, that was offered to Elvis Presley to perform, but Presley declined it.
500012	Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US.
500013	Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "for all his record sales (over a million copies of Ziggy Stardust alone), existed essentially on loose change."
500014	In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager.
500015	At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."
500016	Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.
501000	Station to Station (1976) introduced a new Bowie persona, the "Thin White Duke" of its title track.
501001	Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year.
501002	Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans, Station to Station also prefigured the Krautrock and synthesiser music of his next releases.
501003	The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when Russell Harty interviewed the singer for his London Weekend Television talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour.
501004	Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator General Franco was announced.
501005	Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed.
501006	This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead.
501007	In the ensuing conversation with Harty, as described by biographer David Buckley, "the singer made hardly any sense at all throughout what was quite an extensive interview. ... Bowie looked completely disconnected and was hardly able to utter a coherent sentence."
501008	His sanity-by his own later admission-had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.
501009	Station to Station's January 1976 release was followed in February by a three-and-a-half-month concert tour of Europe and North America.
501010	Featuring a starkly lit set, the Isolar - 1976 Tour highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy title track, the ballads "Wild Is the Wind" and "Word on a Wing", and the funkier "TVC 15" and "Stay". The core band that coalesced around this album and tour-rhythm guitarist Alomar, bassist George Murray, and drummer Dennis Davis-continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s.
501011	The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy.
501012	Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia.
501013	Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, the singer waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME.
501014	Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave.
501015	He later blamed his pro-Fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. "
501016	I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur ...". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs."
502000	Bowie moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of Lake Geneva.
502001	In the new environment, his cocaine use increased; so too did his interest in pursuits outside his musical career.
502002	He took up painting, and produced a number of post-modernist pieces.
502003	When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference.
502004	Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art .... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography". Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career.
502005	Working with Brian Eno while sharing an apartment in Schöneberg with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy.
502006	During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.
502007	Low (1977), partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu!, evidenced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional.
502008	It received considerable negative criticism upon its release-a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent.
502009	Despite these forebodings, Low yielded the UK number three single "Sound and Vision", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two.
502010	Leading contemporary composer Philip Glass described Low as "a work of genius" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his Symphony No. 1 "Low"; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 Symphony No. 4 "Heroes". Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces".
503000	Echoing Low's minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, "Heroes" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp.
503001	Like Low, "Heroes" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.
503002	Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK.
503003	Its title track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.
503004	Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's televised Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in "Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy", a version of "The Little Drummer Boy" with a new, contrapuntal verse.
503005	Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day, 1982.
503006	After completing Low and "Heroes", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries.
503007	By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."
503008	Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year.
503009	The final piece in what Bowie called his "triptych", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era.
503010	The result was a complex mixture of New Wave and World Music, in places incorporating Hejaz non-Western scales.
503011	Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.
503012	The album was recorded in Switzerland.
503013	Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's Sergeant Pepper ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology."
503014	As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end-for fifteen years-of Bowie's partnership with Eno."
503015	Lodger reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "Boys Keep Swinging" and "DJ". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angela initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.
505000	Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number one hit "Ashes to Ashes", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz"-the main New Romantic hangout-to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time.
505001	While Scary Monsters utilised principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically.
505002	The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Pete Townshend, Chuck Hammer and Tom Verlaine.
505003	As "Ashes to Ashes" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring in The Elephant Man.
505004	The same year, he made a cameo appearance in the German film Christiane F., a real-life story of teenage drug addiction in 1970s Berlin.
505005	The Christiane F. soundtrack album, which featured Bowie's music prominently, was released a few months later.
505006	Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, "Under Pressure". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number one single.
505007	Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1981 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal.
505008	Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal.
505009	In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK top 30.
505010	Bowie reached a new peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.
505011	Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US.
505012	Its three singles became top twenty hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. "
505013	Modern Love" and "China Girl" made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of acclaimed promotional videos that, as described by biographer David Buckley, "were totally absorbing and activated key archetypes in the pop world. '
505014	Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aborigine couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film From Here to Eternity), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV.
505015	By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day.
505016	Let's Dance was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms.
505017	The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular."
505018	Stevie Ray Vaughan was guest guitarist playing solo on "Let's Dance".
506000	Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop.
506001	It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit "God Only Knows". The album bore the transatlantic top ten hit "Blue Jean", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, "Jazzin' for Blue Jean". Bowie performed at Wembley in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief.
506002	During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premièred, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. "Dancing in the Street" quickly went to number one on release.
506003	The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record "This Is Not America" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman.
506004	Released as a single, the song became a top 40 hit in the UK and US.
506005	Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners.
506006	It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song rose to number two in the UK charts.
506007	He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs.
506008	His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge.
506009	Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits "Day-In, Day-Out" (his 60th single), "Time Will Crawl", and "Never Let Me Down". Bowie later described it as his "nadir", calling it "an awful album". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May.
506010	Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.
506011	Critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing.
507000	Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s.
507001	A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels.
507002	The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on drums and bass respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.
507003	Though he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.
507004	The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of neo-Nazis"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."
507005	EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production". The album nevertheless reached number three in the UK.
507006	Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance-among fans and critics alike-to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member.
507007	A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label.
507008	Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band.
507009	Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work.
507010	Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.
507011	In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angela, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend.
507012	Bowie recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate."
507013	They married in 1992.
507014	Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second.
507015	Tin Machine II's arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be "in exquisite taste", "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless.
507016	Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.
508000	In April 1992 Bowie appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen frontman's death the previous year.
508001	As well as performing "Heroes" and "All the Young Dudes", he was joined on "Under Pressure" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part.
508002	Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland.
508003	Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived.
508004	They settled in New York instead.
508005	1993 saw the release of Bowie's first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz and hip-hop influenced Black Tie White Noise.
508006	Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number one spot on the UK charts and spawning three top 40 hits, including the top 10 song "Jump They Say". Bowie explored new directions on The Buddha of Suburbia (1993), a soundtrack album of incidental music composed for the TV series adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's novel.
508007	It contained some of the new elements introduced in Black Tie White Noise, and also signalled a move towards alternative rock.
508008	The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made number 87 in the UK charts.
508009	Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial Outside (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder.
508010	Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved US and UK chart success, and yielded three top 40 UK singles.
508011	In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February the following year, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist.
509000	Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996.
509001	Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album became UK top 40 hits.
509002	Bowie's song "I'm Afraid of Americans" from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release.
509003	The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100.
509004	The Earthling Tour took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997.
509005	Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record "(Safe in This) Sky Life" for The Rugrats Movie.
509006	Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as "Safe" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single "Everyone Says 'Hi'". The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track "Without You I'm Nothing", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.
509007	Bowie created the soundtrack for Omikron, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also appeared as characters.
509008	Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album 'Hours...' featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his "Cyber Song Contest" Internet competition, Alex Grant.
509009	Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.
509010	Sessions for the planned album Toy, intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released.
509011	Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.
509012	Alexandria Zahra Jones, Bowie and Iman's daughter, was born on 15 August.
510000	In October 2001, Bowie opened The Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon & Garfunkel's "America", followed by a full band performance of "Heroes". 2002 saw the release of Heathen, and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour.
510001	Taking in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual Meltdown festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director.
510002	Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television and The Dandy Warhols.
510003	As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's Low era.
510004	Reality (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004.
510005	Onstage in Oslo, Norway, on 18 June, Bowie was hit in the eye with a lollipop thrown by a fan; a week later he suffered chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany.
510006	Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg.
510007	The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled.
510008	Following recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie has reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio.
510009	He sang in a duet of his 1972 song "Changes" with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film Shrek 2.
510010	During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song "(She Can) Do That", co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film Stealth.
510011	He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon.
510012	He contributed back-up vocals on TV on the Radio's song "Province" for their album Return to Cookie Mountain, made a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio, and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir's 2005 album No Balance Palace.
511000	Bowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006.
511001	In April, he announced, "I'm taking a year off-no touring, no albums."
511002	He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour's 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
511003	The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released.
511004	He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a New York benefit event for Keep a Child Alive, a performance that marks the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.
511005	Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, selecting musicians and artists for the Manhattan event, and performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay My Head.
511006	On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing-and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with "Space Oddity"-EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix.
511007	A Reality Tour, a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.
511008	In late March 2011, Toy, Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for Heathen and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.
511009	On 8 January 2013 (his 66th birthday), his website announced a new album, to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release 8 March for Australia, 12 March for the United States and 11 March for the rest of the world.
511010	Bowie's first studio album in a decade, The Next Day contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks.
511011	His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus, saying "In recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation, rumour and wishful thinking ... a new record ... who would have ever thought it, who'd have ever dreamed it! After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants ... when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell. Today he definitely has something to say."
511012	Producer Tony Visconti said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record, which he might start work on later in 2013.
511013	The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, "Where Are We Now?", written and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by longtime collaborator Tony Visconti.
511014	A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler.
511015	The single topped the UK ITunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at No. 6, his first single to enter the top 10 for two decades, (since "Jump They Say" in 1993). A second video, "The Stars (Are Out Tonight)", was released 25 February.
511016	Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple.
511017	On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes.
511018	The Next Day debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, his first since Black Tie White Noise (1993), and is currently the fastest-selling album of 2013.
512000	According to The Times, Bowie has ruled out ever giving an interview again, with producer Visconti agreeing with the interviewer's suggestion that he is now Bowie's "voice on earth". Visconti also revealed to The Times that Bowie has no intention of going on tour, noting that all "he wants to do is make records."
512001	Biographer David Buckley writes, "The essence of Bowie's contribution to popular music can be found in his outstanding ability to analyse and select ideas from outside the mainstream-from art, literature, theatre and film-and to bring them inside, so that the currency of pop is constantly being changed."
512002	Buckley says, "Just one person took glam rock to new rarefied heights and invented character-playing in pop, marrying theatre and popular music in one seamless, powerful whole."
512003	Bowie's career has also been punctuated by various roles in film and theatre productions, earning him some acclaim as an actor in his own right.
512004	The beginnings of his acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician.
512005	Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, he was given the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders). In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him.
512006	The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra.
512007	In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nic Roeg.
512008	Just a Gigolo (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her Gigolo Stable.
514000	Bowie portrayed physicist Nikola Tesla in the Christopher Nolan film, The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century.
514001	He voice-acted in the animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, and lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film.
514002	In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, alongside Josh Hartnett and Rip Torn, with whom he had worked in 1976 for The Man Who Fell to Earth.
514003	Buckley writes, "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality."
514004	Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts in the 22 January 1972 issue of Melody Maker, a move which coincided with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust.
514005	In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said: "It's true-I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."
514006	In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake I ever made" and "I was always a closet heterosexual". On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings; as described by Buckley, he said he had been driven more by "a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being". Asked in 2002 by Blender whether he still believed his public declaration was the biggest mistake he ever made, he replied: Interesting. [Long pause] I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer, and I felt that bisexuality became my headline over here for so long. America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.
514007	Buckley's view of the period is that Bowie, "a taboo-breaker and a dabbler ... mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock", and that "it is probably true that Bowie was never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual ... he did, from time to time, experiment, even if only out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'." Biographer Christopher Sandford says that according to Mary Finnigan, with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969, the singer and his first wife Angie "lived in a fantasy world ... and they created their bisexual fantasy."
514008	Sandford tells how, during the marriage, Bowie "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women."
515000	From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie has employed a wide variety of musical styles.
515001	His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by not only rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley but also the wider world of show business.
515002	He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.
515003	Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, "Space Oddity", and later in the song "Heroes", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that "in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness."
515004	Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as "particularly deliberate and distinctive". Schinder and Schwartz call him "a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect." Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's chamaeleon-like nature is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics "arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."
515005	Bowie plays many instruments, among them electric, acoustic, and twelve-string guitar; alto, tenor and baritone saxophone; keyboards including piano, synthesisers and Mellotron; harmonica, Stylophone, xylophone, vibraphone, koto, drums and percussion, and string instruments including viola and cello.
515006	Bowie's innovative songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development.
515007	A pioneer of glam rock, Bowie, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, has joint responsibility with Marc Bolan for creating the genre.
515008	At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement-historian Michael Campbell calls him "one of punk's seminal influences". While punk musicians trashed the conventions of pop stardom, Bowie moved on again-into a more abstract style of music making that in turn became a transforming influence.
515009	Biographer David Buckley writes, "At a time when punk rock was noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance, Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation."
515010	Bowie's record company sought to convey his unique status in popular music with the slogan, "There is old wave, there is new wave, and there is Bowie ..." Musicologist James Perone credits him with having "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledge the intellectual depth of his work and influence.
516000	Buckley writes that, in an early 1970s pop world that was "Bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied, ... Bowie challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day."
516001	As described by John Peel, "The one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change."
516002	Buckley says that Bowie "subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star", with the result that "After Bowie there has been no other pop icon of his stature, because the pop world that produces these rock gods doesn't exist any more. ... The fierce partisanship of the cult of Bowie was also unique-its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."
516003	Buckley concludes that "Bowie is both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture-he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."
516004	Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
516005	Through perpetual reinvention, he has seen his influence continue to broaden and extend: music reviewer Brad Filicky writes that over the decades, "Bowie has become known as a musical chameleon, changing and dictating trends as much as he has altered his style to fit, influencing fashion and pop culture."
516006	Biographer Thomas Forget adds, "Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie."
519000	Judy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 - June 22, 1969) was an American actress, singer and vaudevillian.
519001	Described by Fred Astaire as "the greatest entertainer who ever lived" and renowned for her contralto voice, she attained international stardom throughout a career that spanned more than 40 years as an actress in musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist and on the concert stage.
519002	Respected for her versatility, she received a Juvenile Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award as well as Grammy Awards and a Special Tony Award.
519003	She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the remake of A Star is Born and for the Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg.
519004	She remains the youngest recipient (at 39 years of age) of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the motion picture industry.
519005	After appearing in vaudeville with her two older sisters, Garland was signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager.
519006	There she made more than two dozen films, including nine with Mickey Rooney and the 1939 film with which she would be most identified, The Wizard of Oz.
519007	After 15 years, she was released from the studio but gained renewed success through record-breaking concert appearances, including a return to acting beginning with critically acclaimed performances.
519008	Despite her professional triumphs, Garland struggled immensely in her personal life, starting when she was a child.
519009	Her self-image was strongly influenced by film executives, who said she was unattractive and constantly manipulated her onscreen physical appearance.
519010	She was plagued by financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes.
519011	She married five times, with her first four marriages ending in divorce.
519012	She also had a long battle with drugs and alcohol, which ultimately led to her death at the age of 47.
520000	In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
520001	Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
520002	In 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the ten greatest female stars in the history of American cinema.
520003	Born Frances Ethel Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, Garland was the youngest child of Ethel Marion (née Milne; November 17, 1893 - January 5, 1953) and Francis Avent "Frank" Gumm (March 20, 1886 - November 17, 1935). Her parents were vaudevillians who settled in Grand Rapids, MN, to run a movie theatre that featured vaudeville acts.
520004	Garland's ancestry on both sides of her family can be traced back to the early colonial days of the United States.
520005	Her father was descended from the Marable family of Virginia; her maternal grandfather from the Milnes of Aberdeen, Scotland; and her maternal grandmother from Patrick Fitzpatrick, who emigrated to America in the 1770s from Smithstown, County Meath, Ireland.
520006	Named after both her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church, "Baby" (as she was called by her parents and sisters) shared her family's flair for song and dance.
520007	Her first appearance came at the age of two-and-a-half when she joined her two older sisters, Mary Jane "Suzy/Suzanne" Gumm (1915-1964) and Dorothy Virginia "Jimmie" Gumm (1917-1977), on the stage of her father's movie theater during a Christmas show and sang a chorus of "Jingle Bells". Accompanied by their mother on piano, The Gumm Sisters performed there for the next few years.
520008	Following rumors that Frank Gumm had made sexual advances toward male ushers, the family relocated to Lancaster, California, in June 1926.
520009	Frank purchased and operated another theater in Lancaster, and Ethel, acting as their manager, began working to get her daughters into motion pictures.
520010	Garland attended Hollywood High School and later graduated from University High School (Los Angeles, California).
521000	In 1928, The Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by Ethel Meglin, proprietress of the Meglin Kiddies dance troupe.
521001	They appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.
521002	It was through the Meglin Kiddies that they made their film debut, in a 1929 short subject called The Big Revue where they performed a song and dance number called That's the good old sunny south.
521003	This was followed by appearances in two Vitaphone shorts the following year, A Holiday in Storyland (featuring Garland's first on-screen solo) and The Wedding of Jack and Jill.
521004	They next appeared together in Bubbles.
521005	Their final on-screen appearance came in 1935, in another short entitled La Fiesta de Santa Barbara.
521006	In 1934, the trio, who by then had been touring the vaudeville circuit as "The Gumm Sisters" for many years, performed in Chicago at the Oriental Theater with George Jessel.
521007	He encouraged the group to choose a more appealing name after "Gumm" was met with laughter from the audience.
521008	According to theatrical legend, their act was once erroneously billed at a Chicago theater as "The Glum Sisters."
521009	Several stories persist regarding the origin of the name "Garland."
521010	One is that it was originated by Jessel after Carole Lombard's character Lily Garland in the film Twentieth Century, which was then playing at the Oriental; another is that the girls chose the surname after drama critic Robert Garland.
521011	Garland's daughter, Lorna Luft, stated that her mother selected the name when Jessel announced that the trio "looked prettier than a garland of flowers."
521012	Another variation surfaced when he was a guest on Garland's television show in 1963.
521013	He claimed that he had sent actress Judith Anderson a telegram containing the word "garland" and it stuck in his mind.
521014	By late 1934, the Gumm Sisters had changed their name to the Garland Sisters.
521015	Frances changed her name to "Judy" soon after, inspired by a popular Hoagy Carmichael song.
521016	By August 1935 they were broken up when Suzanne Garland flew to Reno, Nevada, and married musician Lee Kahn, a member of the Jimmy Davis orchestra playing at Cal-Neva Lodge, Lake Tahoe.
522000	Busby Berkeley was asked by Louis B. Mayer to go downtown to the Orpheum Theater, to watch the Gumm Sisters vaudeville act, and to report back to him.
522001	Afterwards, Judy and her mother were brought into the studio for an interview with Louis B. and Busby Berkeley.
522002	In 1935, Garland was signed to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, supposedly without a screen test, though she had made a test for the studio several months earlier.
522003	It did not know what to do with her, as at age 13 she was older than the traditional child star but too young for adult roles.
522004	Her physical appearance created a dilemma for MGM.
522005	At only 4 feet 11.5 inches (151.1 cm), her "cute" or "girl next door" looks did not exemplify the more glamorous persona required of leading ladies of the time.
522006	She was self-conscious and anxious about her appearance. "
522007	Judy went to school at Metro with Ava Gardner, Lana Turner, Elizabeth Taylor, real beauties," said Charles Walters, who directed her in a number of films. "Judy was the big money-maker at the time, a big success, but she was the ugly duckling  ... I think it had a very damaging effect on her emotionally for a long time. I think it lasted forever, really."
522008	Her insecurity was exacerbated by the attitude of studio chief Louis B. Mayer, who referred to her as his "little hunchback."
522009	During her early years at the studio, she was photographed and dressed in plain garments or frilly juvenile gowns and costumes to match the "girl next door" image that was created for her.
522010	She was made to wear removable caps on her teeth and rubberized disks to reshape her nose.
522011	She performed at various studio functions and was eventually cast opposite Deanna Durbin in the musical short Every Sunday.
522012	The film contrasted her alto vocal range and swing style with Durbin's operatic soprano and served as an extended screen test for the pair, as studio executives were questioning the wisdom of having two girl singers on the roster.
522013	Mayer finally decided to keep both actresses, but by that time Durbin's option had lapsed and she was signed by Universal Studios.
523000	On November 16, 1935, in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the Shell Chateau Hour, Garland learned that her father, who had been hospitalized with meningitis, had taken a turn for the worse.
523001	Frank Gumm died the following morning, on November 17, leaving her devastated.
523002	Her song for the Shell Chateau Hour was her first professional rendition of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart," a song which would become a standard in many of her concerts.
523003	Garland next came to the attention of studio executives by singing a special arrangement of "You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)" to Clark Gable at a birthday party held by the studio for the actor.
523004	Her rendition was so well regarded that she performed the song in the all-star extravaganza Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937), singing to a photograph of him.
523005	MGM hit on a winning formula when it paired Garland with Mickey Rooney in a string of "backyard musicals."
523006	The duo first appeared together in the 1937 B movie Thoroughbreds Don't Cry as supporting characters.
523007	Judy was then put in the cast of the fourth of the Hardy Family movies as a literal girl next door to Rooney's character, Andy Hardy in Love Finds Andy Hardy, although Hardy's love interest was played by Lana Turner.
523008	They teamed as lead characters for the first time in Babes in Arms.
523009	They starred together in five additional films, including two more of the Hardy films.
523010	To keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given amphetamines as well as barbiturates to take before going to bed.
523011	For Garland, this regular dose of drugs led to addiction and a lifelong struggle and contributed to her eventual demise.
523012	She later resented the hectic schedule and felt that her youth had been stolen from her by MGM.
523013	Despite successful film and recording careers, awards, critical praise and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, she was plagued throughout her life with self-doubt and required constant reassurance that she was talented and attractive.
524000	In 1938, aged 16, she was cast as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939), a film based on the children's book by L. Frank Baum.
524001	In this film, she sang the song with which she would forever be identified, "Over the Rainbow."
524002	Although producers Arthur Freed and Mervyn LeRoy had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer tried first to borrow Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox but declined.
524003	Deanna Durbin was then asked but was unavailable, resulting in Garland being cast.
524004	She was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming.
524005	Her blue gingham dress was chosen for its blurring effect on her figure.
524006	Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938, and was completed on March 16, 1939, with a final cost of more than 2 million US$.
524007	With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of Babes in Arms, directed by Busby Berkeley.
524008	She and Rooney were sent on a cross-country promotional tour culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the Capitol Theater, which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars.
524009	The Wizard of Oz was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated $4 million coupled with the lower revenue generated by children's tickets meant that the film did not make a profit until it was rereleased in the 1940s.
524010	At the 1940 Academy Awards ceremony, Garland received an Academy Juvenile Award for her performances in 1939, including The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Arms.
524011	Following this recognition, she became one of MGM's most bankable stars.
524012	In 1940, she starred in three films: Andy Hardy Meets Debutante, Strike Up the Band, and Little Nellie Kelly.
524013	In the latter, she played her first adult role, a dual role of both mother and daughter.
524014	Little Nellie Kelly was purchased from George M. Cohan as a vehicle for her to display both her audience appeal and her physical appearance.
524015	The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss, and the only death scene of her career.
524016	The success of these three films, and a further three films in 1941, secured her position at MGM as a major property.
525000	During this time Garland experienced her first serious adult romances. The first was with the band leader Artie Shaw.
525001	She was deeply devoted to him and was devastated in early 1940 when he eloped with Lana Turner.
525002	Garland began a relationship with musician David Rose, and on her 18th birthday he gave her an engagement ring.
525003	The studio intervened because he was still married at the time to the actress and singer Martha Raye.
525004	They agreed to wait a year to allow for his divorce to become final and were wed on July 27, 1941.
525005	Garland, who had aborted her pregnancy by him in 1942, agreed to a trial separation in January 1943, and they divorced in 1944.
525006	She was noticeably thinner in her next film, For Me and My Gal, alongside Gene Kelly in his first screen appearance.
525007	She was top billed over the credits for the first time and effectively made the transition from teenage star to adult actress.
525008	At the age of 21, she was given the "glamour treatment" in Presenting Lily Mars, in which she was dressed in "grown-up" gowns.
525009	Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion.
525010	However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the "girl next door" image that had been created for her.
525011	One of Garland's most successful films for MGM was Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), in which she introduced three standards: "The Trolley Song", "The Boy Next Door", and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". Vincente Minnelli was assigned to direct, and he requested that makeup artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland.
525012	Ponedel refined her appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs.
525013	She appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM.
526000	During the filming of Meet Me in St. Louis, after some initial conflict between them, Garland and Minnelli entered a relationship.
526001	They were married June 15, 1945, and on March 12, 1946, daughter Liza was born.
526002	In 1951, they divorced.
526003	The Clock (1945) was her first straight dramatic film, opposite Robert Walker.
526004	Though the film was critically praised and earned a profit, most movie fans expected her to sing.
526005	It would be many years before she acted again in a nonsinging dramatic role.
526006	Garland's other famous films of the 1940s include The Harvey Girls (1946), in which she introduced the Academy Award-winning song "On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe", and The Pirate (1948). During filming for The Pirate in April 1947, Garland suffered a nervous breakdown and was placed in a private sanitarium.
526007	She was able to complete filming, but in July she undertook her first suicide attempt, making minor cuts to her wrist with a broken glass.
526008	During this period, she spent two weeks in treatment at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts For these and other episodes, Garland is thought to have suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder.
526009	Following her work on The Pirate, she completed three more films for MGM: Easter Parade (in which she danced with Fred Astaire), In the Good Old Summertime, and her final film with MGM, Summer Stock.
526010	Because of her mental condition, Garland was unable to complete a series of films.
526011	During the filming of The Barkleys of Broadway, she was taking prescription sleeping medication along with illicitly obtained pills containing morphine.
526012	It was around this time she also developed a serious problem with alcohol.
526013	These, in combination with migraine headaches, led her to miss several shooting days in a row.
526014	After being advised by her doctor that she would only be able to work in four-to-five-day increments with extended rest periods between, MGM executive Arthur Freed made the decision to suspend her on July 18, 1948.
526015	She was replaced by Ginger Rogers.
527000	Garland was cast in the film adaptation of Annie Get Your Gun in the title role of Annie Oakley.
527001	She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with Ethel Merman, anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director Busby Berkeley.
527002	Busby was staging all the musical numbers, and was severe with Garland's lack of effort, attitude and enthusiasm.
527003	Judy complained to Louis B. Mayer, trying to have Berkeley fired from the feature.
527004	She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear.
527005	She was suspended from the picture on May 10, 1949, and was replaced by Betty Hutton, who stepped in performing all the musical routines as staged by Busby Berkeley.
527006	Garland was next cast in the film Royal Wedding with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant in 1950.
527007	She again failed to report to the set on multiple occasions, and the studio suspended her contract on June 17, 1950.
527008	She was replaced by Jane Powell.
527009	Reputable biographies following her death stated that after this latest dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken water glass, requiring only a Band-Aid, but at the time, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat. "
527010	All I could see ahead was more confusion," Garland later said of this suicide attempt. "I wanted to black out the future as well as the past. I wanted to hurt myself and everyone who had hurt me."
527011	In October 1951, Garland opened in a vaudeville-style, two-a-day engagement at Broadway's newly refurbished Palace Theatre.
527012	Her 19-week engagement exceeded all previous records for the theater and was described as "one of the greatest personal triumphs in show business history."
527013	Garland was honored for her contribution to the revival of vaudeville with a Special Tony Award.
528000	In May 1952, her mother Ethel was featured in a Los Angeles Mirror story in which she revealed that while Garland was making a small fortune at the Palace, Ethel was working a desk job at Douglas Aircraft Company for $61 a week.
528001	They had been estranged for years, with Garland characterizing her mother as "no good for anything except to create chaos and fear" and accusing her of mismanaging and misappropriating her salary from the earliest days of her career.
528002	Garland's sister Virginia denied this, stating "Mama never took a dime from Judy."
528003	On January 5, 1953, Ethel Gumm was found dead in the Douglas Aircraft parking lot.
528004	She was 59 years old.
528005	Garland filmed a musical remake of the film A Star is Born for Warner Bros. in 1954.
528006	Garland and Sidney Luft, her then-husband, produced the film through their production company, Transcona Enterprises, while Warner Bros. supplied the funds, production facilities, and crew.
528007	Directed by George Cukor and costarring James Mason, it was a large undertaking to which she initially fully dedicated herself.
528008	As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness which she had so often made during her final films at MGM.
528009	Production delays led to cost overruns and angry confrontations with Warner Bros. head Jack Warner.
528010	Principal photography wrapped on March 17, 1954.
528011	At Luft's suggestion, the "Born in a Trunk" medley was filmed as a showcase for her and inserted over director Cukor's objections, who feared the additional length would lead to cuts in other areas.
528012	It was completed on July 29.
528013	Upon its September 29, 1954 world premiere, the film was met with tremendous critical and popular acclaim.
528014	Before release, it was edited at the instruction of Jack Warner; theater operators, concerned that they were losing money because they were only able to run the film for three or four shows per day instead of five or six, pressured the studio to make additional reductions.
528015	About 30 minutes of footage was cut, sparking outrage among critics and filmgoers.
528016	A Star is Born ended up losing money, and the secure financial position Garland had expected from the profits did not materialize.
528017	Transcona made no more films with Warner.
529000	Garland was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and in the run-up to the 27th Academy Awards, was generally expected to win.
529001	She could not attend the ceremony because she had just given birth to her son, Joseph Luft, so a television crew was in her hospital room with cameras and wires to televise her anticipated acceptance speech.
529002	The Oscar was won, however, by Grace Kelly for The Country Girl (1954). The camera crew was packing up before Kelly could even reach the stage.
529003	Groucho Marx sent her a telegram after the awards ceremony, declaring her loss "the biggest robbery since Brinks."
529004	TIME magazine labeled her performance as "just about the greatest one-woman show in modern movie history."
529005	Garland won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical for the role.
529006	Garland's films after A Star Is Born included Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) (for which she was Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated for Best Supporting Actress), the animated feature Gay Purr-ee (1962), and A Child Is Waiting (1963) with Burt Lancaster.
529007	Her final film was I Could Go On Singing (1963), costarring Dirk Bogarde.
529008	Garland engaged Sid Luft as her manager the same year she divorced Minnelli.
529009	He arranged a four-month concert tour of the United Kingdom, where she played to sold-out audiences throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland.
529010	It included her first appearances at the renowned London Palladium, for a four-week stand in April.
529011	Although some in the British press chided her before her opening for being "too plump," she received rave reviews and the ovation was described by the Palladium manager as the loudest he had ever heard.
529012	Garland and Luft were married on June 8, 1952, in Hollister, California.
529013	Garland gave birth to Lorna Luft, herself a future actress and singer, on November 21, 1952, and to Joey Luft on March 29, 1955.
530000	Beginning in 1955, Garland appeared in a number of television specials. The first, the 1955 debut episode of Ford Star Jubilee, was the first full-scale color broadcast ever on CBS and was a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 Nielsen rating.
530001	She signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network.
530002	Only one additional special, a live concert edition of General Electric Theater, was broadcast in 1956 before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials.
530003	In 1956, Garland performed four weeks at the New Frontier Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for a salary of $55,000 per week, making her the highest-paid entertainer to work in Las Vegas.
530004	Despite a brief bout of laryngitis, her performances there were so successful that her run was extended an extra week.
530005	Later that year she returned to the Palace Theatre, site of her two-a-day triumph.
530006	She opened in September, once again to rave reviews and popular acclaim.
530007	In November 1959, Garland was hospitalized, diagnosed with acute hepatitis.
530008	Over the next few weeks several quarts of fluid were drained from her body until, still weak, she was released from the hospital in January 1960.
530009	She was told by doctors that she likely had five years or less to live, and that even if she did survive she would be a semi-invalid and would never sing again.
530010	She initially felt "greatly relieved" at the diagnosis. "
530011	The pressure was off me for the first time in my life."
530012	However, she recovered over the next several months and, in August of that year, returned to the stage of the Palladium.
530013	She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England.
530014	Her concert appearance at Carnegie Hall on April 23, 1961, was a considerable highlight, called by many "the greatest night in show business history". The two-record Judy at Carnegie Hall was certified gold, charting for 95 weeks on Billboard, including 13 weeks at number one.
530015	The album won four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal of the Year.
530016	The album has never been out of print.
531000	In 1961, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, Freddie Fields, and negotiated a new round of specials.
531001	The first, entitled The Judy Garland Show, aired in 1962 and featured guests Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.
531002	Following this success, CBS made a $24 million offer to her for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called The Judy Garland Show, which was deemed at the time in the press to be "the biggest talent deal in TV history."
531003	Although she had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation.
531004	She was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the failure of A Star is Born meant that she received nothing from that investment.
531005	A successful run on television was intended to secure her financial future.
531006	Following a third special, Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet, Garland's weekly series debuted September 29, 1963.
531007	The Judy Garland Show was critically praised, but for a variety of reasons (including being placed in the time slot opposite Bonanza on NBC) the show lasted only one season and was canceled in 1964 after 26 episodes.
531008	Despite its short run, the series was nominated for four Emmy Awards.
531009	The demise of the series was personally and financially devastating for Garland.
531010	Garland sued Luft for divorce in 1963, claiming "cruelty" as the grounds.
531011	She also asserted that he had repeatedly struck her while he was drinking and that he had attempted to take their children from her by force.
531012	She had filed for divorce from Luft more than once previously, including as early as 1956, but had reconciled.
532000	With the demise of her television series, Garland returned to the stage.
532001	Most notably, she performed at the London Palladium with her then 18-year-old daughter Liza Minnelli in November 1964.
532002	The concert, which was also filmed for British television network ITV, was one of her final appearances at the venue.
532003	She made guest appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.
532004	Garland guest-hosted an episode of The Hollywood Palace with Vic Damone.
532005	She was invited back for a second episode in 1966 with Van Johnson as her guest.
532006	Issues with Garland's behavior ended her Hollywood Palace guest appearances.
532007	A 1964 tour of Australia was largely disastrous.
532008	Garland's first concert in Sydney, held in the Sydney Stadium because no concert hall could accommodate the crowds who wanted to see her, went well and received positive reviews.
532009	Her second performance, in Melbourne, started an hour late.
532010	The crowd of 7,000, angered by her tardiness and believing her to be drunk, booed and heckled her, and she fled the stage after just 45 minutes.
532011	She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as "brutish."
532012	A second concert in Sydney was uneventful but the Melbourne appearance garnered her significant bad press.
532013	Some of that bad press was deflected by the announcement of a near fatal episode of pleurisy.
532014	Garland's tour promoter Mark Herron announced that they had married aboard a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong; however, she was not legally divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.
532015	The divorce became final on May 19, 1965, and she and Herron did not legally marry until November 14, 1965; they separated six months later.
532016	In February 1967, Garland was cast as Helen Lawson in Valley of the Dolls for 20th Century Fox.
532017	During the filming, she missed rehearsals and was fired in April, replaced by Susan Hayward.
532018	Her prerecording of the song "I'll Plant My Own Tree" survived, along with her wardrobe tests.
533000	Returning to the stage, Garland made her last appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July, a 16-show stand, performing with her children Lorna and Joey Luft.
533001	She wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in Valley of the Dolls.
533002	By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated.
533003	She performed in London at the Talk of the Town nightclub for a five-week run and made her last concert appearance in Copenhagen during March 1969.
533004	She married her fifth and final husband, musician Mickey Deans, at Chelsea Register Office, London, on March 15, 1969, her divorce from Herron having been finalized on February 11.
533005	On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead by Deans in the bathroom of their rented house in Chelsea, London.
533006	At the subsequent inquest, coroner Gavin Thursdon stated that the cause of death was "an incautious self-overdose" of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of ten 1.5-grain (97 mg) Seconal capsules.
533007	Thursdon stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that there was no evidence to suggest she had committed suicide.
533008	Her autopsy showed that there was no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue there, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in one dose.
533009	Her death certificate stated that her death had been "accidental."
533010	Even so, a British specialist who had attended her said she had been living on borrowed time owing to cirrhosis.
533011	She had turned 47 just twelve days before her death.
533012	Her Wizard of Oz costar Ray Bolger commented at her funeral, "She just plain wore out."
533013	On June 26, Deans took Garland's remains to New York City, where an estimated 20,000 people lined up for hours at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan to pay their respects.
533014	On June 27, James Mason gave a eulogy at the funeral, an Episcopal service led by the Rev. Peter A. Delaney of St Marylebone Parish Church, London, who had officiated at her marriage to Deans.
533015	The public and press were barred.
533016	She was interred in a crypt in the community mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery, in Hartsdale, New York.
534000	Garland's legacy as a performer and a personality has endured long after her death.
534001	The American Film Institute named her eighth among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time.
534002	She has been the subject of over two dozen biographies since her death, including the well-received Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir by her daughter, Lorna Luft, whose memoir was later adapted into the television miniseries Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows, which won Emmy Awards for the two actresses portraying her (Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis). Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
534003	Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
534004	These include "Over the Rainbow", which was ranked as the number one movie song of all time in the American Film Institute's "100 Years...100 Songs" list.
534005	Four more Garland songs are featured on the list: "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (#76), "Get Happy" (#61), "The Trolley Song" (#26), and "The Man That Got Away" (#11). She has twice been honored on U.S. postage stamps, in 1989 (as Dorothy) and again in 2006 (as Vicki Lester from A Star Is Born). Garland always had a large base of fans in the gay community and has become a gay icon.
534006	Reasons often given for her standing, especially among gay men, are admiration of her ability as a performer, the way her personal struggles mirrored those of gay men in America during the height of her fame and her value as a camp figure.
534007	When asked in the 1960s about how she felt about having a large gay following by Irv Kupcinet she famously said, "I couldn't care less. I sing to people."
534008	Some have also suggested a connection between the date of Garland's death and funeral on June 27, 1969 and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern Gay Liberation movement, which started in the early hours of June 28.
534009	In a 2009 interview gay historian David Carter stated that this connection is untrue, and based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in the Village Voice the next day.
534010	However the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron Sylvia Rivera had come from the Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn.
534011	Rivera said that indeed there was a feeling in the air that something would happen that night: "I guess Judy Garland's death just really helped us really hit the fan."
534012	The two events are deeply connected in the lore of the gay community.
536000	Jack Leonard "J. L." Warner (August 2, 1892 – September 9, 1978), born Jacob Warner in London, Ontario, was a Canadian born American film executive who was the president and driving force behind the Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.
536001	Warner's career spanned some forty-five years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls.
536002	As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry's first talking picture.
536003	After Sam's death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner.
536004	He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers' shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks.
536005	Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and toughmindedness.
536006	He recruited many of Warner Bros.'s top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known.
536007	Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, "If I'm right fifty-one percent of the time, I'm ahead of the game."
536008	Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure.
536009	Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
536010	He opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America's involvement in World War II.
536011	An opponent of Communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers.
536012	Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.
537000	Jack Warner was born in London, Ontario, Canada in 1892.
537001	His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland who spoke mainly Yiddish.
537002	Jack was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner a cobbler from Krasnosielc, Poland (then located in the Russian Empire) and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum.
537003	Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age.
537004	One of the surviving children was Jack's eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry). The Warner family had occupied a "hostile world", where the "night-riding of cossacks, the burning of houses, and the raping of women were part of life's burden for the Jews of the 'shtetl'". In 1888, in search of a better future for his family and himself, Benjamin made his way to Hamburg, Germany, and then took a ship to America.
537005	The Warner surname was perhaps originally "Wonsal" or "Wonskolaser" Upon arriving in New York City, Benjamin introduced himself as "Benjamin Warner", and the surname "Warner" remained with him for the rest of his life.
537006	Pearl Warner and the couple's two children joined him in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year later.
537007	In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.
537008	Benjamin Warner's decision to move to Canada in the early 1890s was inspired by a friend's advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs.
537009	Their sons Jack and David were born in Ontario.
537010	After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family.
537011	Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.
537012	In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.
537013	Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city's downtown area.
538000	Jack spent much of his youth in Youngstown.
538001	He observed in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities.
538002	Warner wrote: "J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl."
538003	Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake's Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city's downtown area.
538004	Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring "song-and-dance man". During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner.
538005	Jack's older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. "
538006	Get out front where they pay the actors," Sam Warner advised Jack. "That's where the money is."
538007	In Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry.
538008	In the early 20th century, Sam Warner formed a business partnership with another local resident and "took over" the city's Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for "cheap vaudeville and photoplays". The venture failed after one summer.
538009	Sam Warner then secured a job as a projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park.
538010	He convinced the family of the new medium's possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B Kinetoscope from a projectionist who was "down on his luck". The purchase price was $1,000, and Jack Warner contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse, according to his obituary.
538011	The enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of The Great Train Robbery throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania before renting a vacant store in New Castle, Pennsylvania.
538012	This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.
538013	Jack, who was still living in Youngstown at the time, arrived on weekends "to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes". In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace.
538014	They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.
538015	That year, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees.
538016	In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business; he sent his younger brother to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company.
538017	Later that year, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for "$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000" (equivalent to $1,328,696 today).
539000	The Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910.
539001	Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust.
539002	That same year, Jack Warner acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante's Inferno.
539003	Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust.
539004	He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles.
539005	The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market.
539006	In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company.
539007	Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities.
539008	The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California.
539009	In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam.
539010	In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.
539011	Warner Bros. followed up the success of My Four Years in Germany with a popular serial titled The Tiger's Claw in 1919.
539012	That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner's sole screen appearance.
539013	During this period, the studio earned few profits; and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts.
539014	Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue., known today as Sunset Bronson Studios.
539015	The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio's image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality.
540000	The studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923.
540001	The canine made his debut in Where the North Begins, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper.
540002	According to one biographer, Jack Warner's initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, "who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics."
540003	Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio's most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound.
540004	Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio's features.
540005	Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner's right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.
540006	Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, however, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood's "Big Three" - Paramount, Universal, and First National studios.
540007	In 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph.
540008	Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking "shorts" using the newly developed Vitaphone technology.
540009	Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer), and Jack became sole head of production.
540010	Sam's death left Jack inconsolable.
540011	One biographer writes, "Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam's sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature.
540012	Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry.
540013	In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand.
540014	Following his brother's death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees.
541000	As the family grieved over Sam's sudden passing, the success of The Jazz Singer helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio.
541001	While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits.
541002	Hollywood's five major studios, which controlled most of the nation's movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of "talking pictures". In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced 12 "talkies" in 1928 alone.
541003	The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for "revolutionizing the industry with sound". Despite Warner Bros.'s new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs.
541004	He placed the studio's directors on a quota system, and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were.
541005	The studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including "backstage musicals," "crusading biopics," "swashbucklers," and "women's pictures."
541006	As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was "a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners' collective output from that of its competitors". Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack Warner tended to support.
541007	These included gangster classics such as Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as well as the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni.
541008	Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Warner's political outlook.
541009	By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a "Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant" at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt's honor.
541010	This development foreshadowed an "era in which Warner would recruit the most New Dealish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers".
542000	During this period, Warner took an active role in recruiting talent.
542001	To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed "star power", he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries.
542002	This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount Studios - William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton.
542003	In 1929, Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film Disraeli, a project that turned out to be a box-office hit.
542004	Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called Penny Arcade.
542005	Although Cagney turned out to be Warner's greatest prize, he was also the studio executive's biggest professional challenge.
542006	During his frequent arguments with Warner, Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Hell's Kitchen district of New York City.
542007	According to a 1937 Fortune magazine article, Warner's most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, "who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four."
542008	The studio's executive producer, Darryl F. Zanuck, resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933.
542009	According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Hays, then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck requested a higher salary and "indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing". That year, Zanuck established 20th Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporation in 1935.
542010	Longtime producer for the studio, Hal B. Wallis, took over as the studio's executive producer.
542011	Warner, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio.
542012	Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio's screenwriters.
542013	Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected "not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks".
543000	Meanwhile, Jack Warner's role in production became somewhat limited.
543001	After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film's production until it was ready for preview.
543002	Nevertheless, Warner could be heavyhanded in his dealings with employees, and he was "merciless in his firings."
543003	Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Warner "derived pleasure" from humiliating subordinates. "
543004	Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch," Reinhardt said, "but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. [Louis B.] Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was."
543005	Warner's management style frustrated many studio employees.
543006	Comedian Jack Benny, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, "Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie". Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio's executive dining room, with the explanation, "I don't need to look at actors when I eat."
543007	The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.
543008	Among these was Bette Davis, one of the studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract.
543009	In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money."
543010	Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. "
543011	We became father and child, no question about it." she said. "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him."
543012	Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn.
543013	In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time.
543014	In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.
544000	As the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism.
544001	As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, "as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of anti-Semitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism."
544002	Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production in 1918 of My Four Years in Germany.
544003	In 1917, while still in distribution War Brides, the Warners had secured the rights for, a film that featured Alla Nazimova as "a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic."
544004	Beyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.
544005	Warner later described the incident in the following terms: "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there."
544006	Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Bros. produced films openly critical of Germany's fascist government.
544007	In 1939, the studio released Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson.
544008	The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of agent Leon Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent.
544009	Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an "aura of authenticity", and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film "the appearance of a newsreel."
544010	Confessions of a Nazi Spy was widely attacked.
544011	Critic Pare Lorentz wrote, "The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one."
544012	The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and German dictator Adolf Hitler, who screened the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged.
544013	Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. lawmaker Martin Dies about defaming a "friendly country."
545000	Initially, the studio bowed to pressure from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects.
545001	Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more "propaganda pictures" and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme.
545002	In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including Underground and All Through the Night.
545003	In 1940, the studio produced shorts that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London.
545004	Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with films such as Captains of the Clouds.
545005	In 1941, Warner also produced the influential pro-war film Sergeant York.
545006	Contemporary reports that Jack Warner had banned the use of the German language throughout the company's Burbank studio were denied by studio representatives, who indicated this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other.
545007	At the start of American participation in the war, like other studio heads, Jack Warner was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States.
545008	In 1943, Warner, at the advice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, produced a film adaption of the controversial book Mission to Moscow; a film intended to inspire public support for the uneasy military alliance the United States had with the Soviet Union.
545009	Later, while testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee on October 27, 1947, Warner dismissed Cold War allegations that the film was subversive, arguing that Mission to Moscow was produced "only to help a desperate war effort and not for posterity."
545010	After the film's lackluster release, the Republican National Committee accused Warner of releasing the film as "New Deal propaganda."
545011	In line with the Warner brothers' early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services studio.
545012	In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.
546000	Jack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s.
546001	Initially, he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as 3-D films, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.
546002	In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, Warner Bros. Presents.
546003	The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as Maverick, Bronco, and Colt .45.
546004	Within a few years, Warner, accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner He, provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute.
546005	was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium.
546006	Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company's new television department.
546007	During this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio's cartoon operation.
546008	Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros."
553000	Elvis Aaron Presleya (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor.
553001	A cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name Elvis.
553002	One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or "the King". Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at the age of 13.
553003	He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience.
553004	Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues.
553005	RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades.
553006	Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit.
553007	He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records.
553008	His energized interpretations of songs, many from African-American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and controversial.
553009	In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.
553010	Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work.
553011	He staged few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided.
553012	In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours.
553013	In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii.
553014	Prescription drug abuse his severely deteriorated health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42.
554000	Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture.
554001	He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including country, pop ballads, gospel, and blues.
554002	He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music.
554003	Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys, he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36.
554004	He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.
554005	Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to 18-year-old Vernon Elvis and 22-year-old Gladys Love Presley, in the two-room shotgun house built by his father in readiness for the birth.
554006	Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him.
554007	As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond with his mother.
554008	The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.
554009	Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: on his mother's side, he was Scots-Irish, with some French Norman; one of Gladys' great-great-grandmothers was Cherokee.b His father's forebears were of Scottish and German origin.
554010	Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family.
554011	Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition.
554012	The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance.
554013	In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner.
554014	He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.
554015	In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his instructors regarded him as "average". He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song "Old Shep" during morning prayers.
554016	The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance: dressed as a cowboy Presley, the ten-year-old stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth.
554017	A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.
554018	Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church.
554019	Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it."
555000	Entering a new school, Milam, for sixth grade in September 1946, Presley was regarded as a loner.
555001	The following year, he began bringing his guitar in on a daily basis.
555002	He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played hillbilly music.
555003	The family was by then living in a largely African-American neighborhood.
555004	A devotee of Mississippi Slim's show on the Tupelo radio station WELO, Presley was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, a classmate of Presley's, who often took him into the station.
555005	Slim supplemented Presley's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques.
555006	When his protégé was 12 years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances.
555007	Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.
555008	In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.
555009	After residing for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Courts.
555010	Enrolled at Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade.
555011	When his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise.
555012	A classmate later recalled that the teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing."
555013	He was generally too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy". In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior.
555014	They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.
555015	That September, he began ushering at Loew's State Theater.
555016	Other jobs followed during his school years: Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.
556000	During his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline.
556001	On his own time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's thriving blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers.
556002	By his senior year, he was wearing them.
556003	Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual "Minstrel" show in April 1953.
556004	Singing and playing guitar, he opened with "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer.
556005	Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: "I wasn't popular in school ... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that."
556006	Presley, who never received formal music training or learned to read music, studied and played by ear.
556007	He frequented record stores with jukeboxes and listening booths.
556008	He knew all of Hank Snow's songs and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.
556009	The Southern Gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.
556010	He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American spiritual music.
556011	He adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
556012	Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues—of necessity, in the segregated South, only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.
556013	He certainly listened to the regional radio stations that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues.
556014	Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.
556015	B.B. King recalled that he knew Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.
556016	By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.
557000	In August 1953, Presley walked into the offices of Sun Records.
557001	He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: "My Happiness" and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or was merely interested in what he "sounded like", though there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store.
557002	Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.
557003	Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds."
557004	When she pressed him on whom he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, "I don't sound like nobody."
557005	After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer. Hold."
557006	Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954—"I'll Never Stand In Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.
557007	Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows.
557008	He explained to his father, "They told me I couldn't sing."
557009	Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.
557010	In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.
557011	His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist.
557012	Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving "because you're never going to make it as a singer."
557013	Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.
557014	As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'"
557015	In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenaged singer.
557016	Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice.
557017	Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew.
557018	He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield "Scotty" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.
558000	The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night.
558001	As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "That's All Right". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.
558002	Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?'
558003	And we said, 'We don't know.' '
558004	Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'"
558005	Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.
558006	Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played "That's All Right" on his Red, Hot, and Blue show.
558007	Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was.
558008	The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show.
558009	Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black.
558010	During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.
558011	The trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air club-Presley still sporting his child-size guitar.
558012	At the end of the month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining.
558013	A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.
558014	Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild". Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as "really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something". Soon after, Moore and Black quit their old band to play with Presley regularly, and DJ and promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager.
558015	From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions, and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage.
558016	According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."
558017	Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.
558018	Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival.
558019	The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states.
558020	Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction.
558021	A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.
558022	House drummer D.J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs.
558023	Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances.
558024	Trading in his old guitar for $8 he (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.
559000	By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a substantial regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas.
559001	In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.
559002	Parker—Dutch-born, though he claimed to be from West Virginia—had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned Louisiana governor Jimmie Davis.
559003	Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, he was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow.
559004	Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.
559005	When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing. ...
559006	I just didn't know what to make of it.
559007	There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it."
559008	Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride.
559009	Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network.
559010	By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer.
559011	Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay.
559012	According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly."
559013	The blend came to be known as rockabilly.
559014	At the time, Presley was variously billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".
560000	Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.
560001	The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.
560002	Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys.
560003	So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him.
560004	There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.
560005	They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something."
560006	The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member.
560007	In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" had been a number-one hit the previous year.
560008	Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.
560009	At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.
560010	Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him.
560011	After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.c Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.
560012	Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all of the new material recorded by Presley.
560013	Songwriters were obliged to forego one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions.
560014	By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.
561000	On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in Nashville.
561001	Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, to fill out the sound.
561002	The session produced the moody, unusual "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27.
561003	Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months.
561004	The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey.
561005	After his first appearance, on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio.
561006	The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the Billboard country chart.
561007	Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager.
561008	RCA Victor released Presley's self-titled debut album on March 23.
561009	Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety.
561010	There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune.
561011	The others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll : "Blue Suede Shoes" - "an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic Robert Hilburn and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters.
561012	As described by Hilburn, these "were the most revealing of all.
561013	Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them.
561014	He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases."
561015	It became the first rock-and-roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for 10 weeks.
561016	While Presley was not an innovative instrumentalist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."
562000	Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's Milton Berle Show on April 3.
562001	His performance, on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.
562002	A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.
562003	Twelve weeks after its "Heartbreak Hotel" original release, became Presley's first number-one pop hit.
562004	In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.
562005	The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests-"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", wrote a critic for Newsweek.
562006	Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.
562007	He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days.
562008	He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas, and was struck by their cover of "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.
562009	It became the new closing number of his act.
562010	After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.
562011	It warned that "Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph."
563000	The second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour.
563001	Berle persuaded the singer to leave his guitar backstage, advising, "Let 'em see you, son."
563002	During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of "Hound Dog" with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements.
563003	Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy.
563004	Television critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway."
563005	Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult."
563006	The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York.
563007	Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bow tie and black tails.
563008	Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie.
563009	As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and simply worked the singer into the customary "comedy fabric" of his program.
563010	Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.
563011	Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show.
563012	Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. ... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music. ... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"
564000	The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", along with "Any Way You Want Me" and "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s.
564001	A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."
564002	In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act.
564003	Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.
564004	The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.
564005	Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September.
564006	Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "Love Me". Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten CBS's Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings.
564007	Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.
564008	The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.
564009	Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan recuperated from a car accident.
564010	Presley appeared in two segments that night from CBS Television City in Los Angeles.
564011	According to Elvis legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up.
564012	Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants–so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a Coke bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"
564013	Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."
564014	In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows.
564015	Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming.
564016	Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.
564017	More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.
565000	Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize.
565001	Igniting the "biggest pop craze since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra ... Presley brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture", writes historian Marty Jezer. "As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture."
565002	The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered.
565003	Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."
565004	At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to prevent crowd trouble.
565005	Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one.
565006	Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."
565007	Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28.
565008	After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.
565009	His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21.
565010	Though he was not top billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month.
565011	To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.
565012	The movie was panned by the critics but did very well at the box office.
565013	Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.
566000	On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording and jammed with them.
566001	Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure the session was captured on tape.
566002	The results became legendary as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordings—Johnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but he was present only briefly at Phillips' instigation for a photo opportunity.
566003	The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales, and Billboard's declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.
566004	In his first full year on RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.
566005	Presley made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist.
566006	Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.
566007	In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out."
566008	To close Presley, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, sang a gentle black spiritual, "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy". Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.
567000	Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "Too Much", "All Shook Up", and "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released.
567001	Under the headline "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet", The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.
567002	Between film shoots and recording sessions, the singer also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles (13 km) south of downtown Memphis for himself and his parents: Graceland.
567003	Loving You—the soundtrack to his second film, released in July—was Presley's third straight number one album.
567004	The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next movie.
567005	The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm". The title track was yet another number one hit, as was the Jailhouse Rock EP.
567006	Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.
567007	A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed."
567008	Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage.
567009	Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon.
567010	In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."
567011	Asked for a response, Presley said, "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."
586000	With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands.
586001	A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician.
586002	He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.
586003	He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success.
586004	The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal.
586005	Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man's Blues.
586006	On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bass player and singer.
586007	During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist, while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens.
586008	His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage, who advised Depp to pursue an acting career.
586009	Depp and his wife divorced in 1985.
586010	Both Depp and his subsequent fiancé Sherilyn Fenn auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's second major role.
586011	Depp was later turned down by the film's producer, who rejected the director's decision.
586012	Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox television series, 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987.
586013	Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him.
586014	Depp's long-time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish.
586015	The series' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s.
586016	Despite this success, Depp felt "forced into the role of product."
586017	Depp subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.
586018	Depp and his co-stars, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson, briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series' 2012 feature film adaptation, which featured a much more comedic tone than the series.
587000	Depp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street, playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson (played by Heather Langenkamp) and one of Freddy Krueger's victims.
587001	Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin', chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.
587002	In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's Platoon.
587003	In 1990, he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands.
587004	The film's success began his long association with Burton.
587005	Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke) in 1998's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name.
587006	Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.
587007	In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson, a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com.
587008	In 2008, he narrated the documentary film Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
587009	Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in Aspen, Colorado, where Thompson lived.
587010	He returned to Thompson's work with a film adaptation of the novel The Rum Diary, released in 2011.
587011	Critics have described Depp's roles as characters who are "iconic loners."
587012	Depp has noted this period of his career was full of "studio defined failures" and films that were "box office poison," but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.
587013	Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.
588000	The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp's performance as the suave but shambling pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised.
588001	Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public.
588002	According to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp was a major draw for audiences.
588003	The film's director, Gore Verbinski, has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.
588004	Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role.
588005	In 2004, he was again nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland.
588006	Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.
588007	Depp reprised the role of Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), and On Stranger Tides (2011), which were each also major box office successes.
588008	Depp has said that Sparrow is "definitely a big part of me," and he even voiced the character in the video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.
588009	His swashbuckling sword talents, as developed for the character of Sparrow, were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade.
588010	Within the film, swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl.
588011	Anderson described Depp's ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be "about as good as you can get."
589000	Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys.
589001	Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton's film adaptation of the musical, for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
589002	Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his "unwavering trust and support."
589003	Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell.
589004	All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger's daughter, Matilda.
589005	He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton's Alice in Wonderland, and the titular character in Rango.
589006	In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros.' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971.
589007	He had been a fan as a child.
589008	Depp and Graham King produced the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006.
589009	Depp will film a documentary about Keith Richards.
589010	Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi.
589011	Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man.
589012	Depp was going to star as Tonto in 2013's Lone Ranger film, but the project had been shelved because of budgetary concerns, as well as a lackluster response to the 2012 science-fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens.
589013	The project was revived and the film will be released on May 31, 2013.
589014	Depp plans to star as Carl Kolchak in the project Night Stalker, and has bought rights to the comic book The Vault.
589015	Depp is in final negotiations to star in the film adaptation of the musical, Into the Woods.
589016	His role in the movie is uncertain though Variety reports that he will play the Baker while the Hollywood Reporter says he will play the Wolf.
591000	In 2004, Depp formed his production company Infinitum Nihil to develop projects where he will serve as actor and/or producer.
591001	Depp is the founder and CEO, while his sister, Christi Dembrowski, serves as president.
591002	The company's first production came in 2011 with The Rum Diary, adapted from the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson.
591003	The film is written and directed by Bruce Robinson.
591004	Also in 2011, Hugo, directed by Martin Scorsese, was released.
591005	Dark Shadows, directed by Tim Burton, was released in 2012.
591006	As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song "Fade In-Out" (from Be Here Now, 1997), as well as on "Fade Away (Warchild Version)" (b-side of the "Don't Go Away" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
591007	He is a friend of The Pogues' Shane MacGowan, and performed on MacGowan's first solo album.
591008	He was also a member of P, a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones.
591009	He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' music video "Into the Great Wide Open" and The Lemonheads "It's a Shame About Ray" music video.

591012	also performing live with Marilyn Manson in the Revolver Golden Gods Awards 2012, performing various songs of Marilyn Manson.
591013	He also appeared in the music video of "My Valentine" from the album Kisses on the Bottom by Paul McCartney released in February 2012, along with Natalie Portman.
592000	Depp and Paradis grew grapes and had wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez.
592001	Along with Sean Penn, John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall, Depp co-owned the French restaurant-bar Man Ray, located near the Champs-Élysées.
592002	In July 2012, Depp announced he would be co-editor, alongside Douglas Brinkley, of folk singer Woody Guthrie's unpublished novel "House of Earth", scheduled for release in 2013.
592003	Depp was married to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985.
592004	He was later successively engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn in the late 1980s before proposing in 1990 to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder, for whom he tattooed "WINONA FOREVER" on his right arm.
592005	In 1998, following a four-year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss, Depp began a relationship with Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate.
592006	After months of media speculation, Depp and Paradis announced their separation in June 2012.
592007	Depp has two children with Paradis: daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999), and son John "Jack" Christopher Depp III (born 2002). In 2007, Depp's daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay.
592008	To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital, Depp visited the hospital in November 2007, dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit, and spent four hours reading stories to the children.
592009	In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital.
592010	Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him "real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything."
592011	"You can't plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny; kismet. All the math finally worked."
592012	While with Paradis, Depp divided his time amongst their home in Meudon, located in the suburbs of Paris; two homes in Los Angeles; an island he bought in The Bahamas; their £500,000 ($1m) townhouse in Bath, Somerset and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour, a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez, in the south of France.
592013	Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007.
592014	Several reports indicated Depp bought Burnham Westgate Hall in Norfolk, England, a 13-bedroom Georgian country house, in June 2011.
593000	In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite.
593001	He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis.
593002	On the 16 October 2011 episode of Larry King Live, when asked by Larry King if he had faith, Depp replied, "Yes. I have faith in my kids. And I have - I have faith, you know, that as long as you keep moving forward, just keep walking forward, things will be all right, I suppose, you know. Faith in terms of religion, I don't - religion is not my specialty, you know."
593003	Depp has around 13 tattoos, many of them signifying important persons or events in his life.
593004	They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading "Wino Forever" (originally "Winona Forever", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps, "Lily-Rose" (his daughter's name) over his heart, "Betty Sue" (his mother's name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word "Jack" (his son's name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean) on his right forearm.
593005	In 2003, Depp told Germany's Stern magazine, "America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive."
593006	Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN.com in its coverage of the interview.
593007	CNN added his remark that he would like his children "to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."
593008	The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the "dumb puppy" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine.
593009	Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that perceived him as a "European wannabe", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.
594000	In 2011, Depp became a U.S. resident again, because France wanted him to become a permanent resident, which he said would require him to pay income tax in both countries.
594001	Depp was adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, on May 22, 2012; this makes him an honorary member of Harris's family, but not an enrolled member of the Nation.
594002	Harris, president of Americans for Indian Opportunity, invited him to join her family after hearing he would be portraying the role of Tonto as a Comanche in The Lone Ranger, a feature film scheduled for 2013 release.
594003	The ceremony took place at Harris’s home; Comanche Nation Tribal Administrator Johnny Wauqua was in attendance.
594004	Depp was presented with gifts by the family, which he then presented to the attendees, as per tradition.
594005	Controversy arose over both the adoption and Depp's portrayal of a Native American character, as Depp was not raised in, nor has confirmable ancestry from, a Native American community, though he has said he "guesses" he may have some distant Cherokee or Creek ancestry.
594006	Some have wondered why he has not verified his Native American ancestry with the Cherokee or any tribe when the information is easily available.
594007	His comment that if you're Native American, "you have to think, somewhere along the line, I’m the product of some horrific rape" was believed by many Indians to be ignorant and insensitive.
594008	On the original Lone Ranger radio show, Tonto was identified as being from the Potawatomi tribe.
599000	Sir James Paul McCartney, MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and composer.
599001	With John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame as a member of the Beatles, and his collaboration with Lennon is one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.
599002	After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career, later forming Wings with his first wife, Linda, and singer-songwriter Denny Laine.
599003	Guinness World Records described McCartney as the "most successful composer and recording artist of all time", with 60 gold discs and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million singles, and as the "most successful songwriter" in United Kingdom chart history.
599004	More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song "Yesterday", more than any other song in history.
599005	Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK.
599006	Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in March 1999, McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2013 he has sold over 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States.
599007	McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music.
599008	He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, landmines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.
599009	McCartney has married three times and is the father of five children.
599010	McCartney was born on 18 June 1942, in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse.
599011	His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II.
599012	Paul has one younger brother, Michael (born 7 January 1944). Though the children were baptised in their mother's Roman Catholic faith, their father, a former Protestant turned agnostic, felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings, so he and Mary did not emphasise religion in the household.
600000	McCartney had attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton.
600001	In 1953, he passed the 11-plus exam, with only three others out of ninety examinees, gaining admission to the Liverpool Institute.
600002	In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus to the Institute from his suburban home in Speke.
600003	Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school, where most pupils went until becoming eligible to work.
600004	The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: "I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger."
600005	As the family's primary wage earner, Mary's income as a midwife had enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964.
600006	She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at "about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow". On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an embolism.
600007	McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, had died when he was seventeen.
600008	A trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s, McCartney's father kept an upright piano in the front room, and he encouraged his sons to be musical.
600009	Jim gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, Paul traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.
600010	He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman also played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.
600011	McCartney wrote his first song, "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become "When I'm Sixty-Four" on the piano.
600012	Against his father's advice, he took few piano lessons, preferring to learn by ear.
600013	Heavily influenced by American rhythm and blues music his, Little Richard was schoolboy idol."
600014	Long Tall Sally" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlins holiday camp talent competition.
601000	At the age of fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton on 6 July 1957.
601001	The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences.
601002	The band invited McCartney to join soon afterwards as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon.
601003	Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.
601004	By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including Beatals, Johnny and the Moondogs and the Silver Beetles.
601005	They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.
601006	Informally represented by Allan Williams, the Beatles' first booking was for a series of performances in Hamburg, starting in 1960.
601007	In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player.
601008	They recorded professionally for the first time while in Hamburg, credited as the Beat Brothers, as the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single "My Bonnie". This brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein, a key figure in their subsequent development and success.
601009	He became their manager in January 1962.
601010	Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, "Love Me Do", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later.
601011	Their fans' hysteria became known as "Beatlemania", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the "cute Beatle". In 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet.
601012	Included on the Help! LP song, the was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member."
601013	Yesterday" became the most covered song in popular music history.
601014	Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band.
601015	Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, "from  ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director". Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics.
601016	Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue In My Life, both Lennon and McCartney claimed lead authorship for the song, "". McCartney said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."
601017	Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right-Paul was absolutely finicky."
602000	In 1966, the Beatles released the album Revolver.
602001	Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock album, the marked an artistic leap for the Beatles.
602002	The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides, the single "Paperback Writer" preceded the LP's release.
602003	The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, "Rain". The films, described by Harrison as "the forerunner of videos", aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966.
602004	Revolver also included McCartney's "Eleanor Rigby", which featured a string octet.
602005	According to Gould, the song is "a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song". With the exception of some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.
602006	The band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour.
602007	Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project apart from the group—a film score for the UK production The Family Way.
602008	The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations.
602009	The soundtrack failed to chart, but it won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.
602010	Upon the end of the Beatles' performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity.
602011	He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album.
602012	Inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured, McCartney invented the fictional band of the album's title track.
602013	As McCartney explained, "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men ... and [we] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers."
603000	Starting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album.
603001	According to engineer Geoff Emerick, "the Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques ... limiters and ... effects like flanging and ADT."
603002	Their recording of "A Day in the Life" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting.
603003	The sessions produced the double A-side single "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" in February 1967, and the LP followed in June.
603004	McCartney's "She's Leaving Home" was an orchestral pop song.
603005	MacDonald described the track as "[among] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper - imperishable popular art of its time."
603006	Based on an ink drawing by McCartney cover, the LP's included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities.
603007	The Beatles' heavy moustaches reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", wrote Gould.
603008	Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as "the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded". Epstein's death in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future.
603009	McCartney, stepping in to fill that void, gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of the group Lennon had once led.
603010	His first creative suggestion after this change of leadership was to propose that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour.
603011	The project was "an administrative nightmare throughout", according to Beatles' historian Mark Lewisohn.
603012	McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response.
603013	However, the film's soundtrack was more successful.
603014	It was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five of the band's recent singles.
603015	The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the Magical Mystery Tour LP achieved $8million in sales within three weeks of its release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.
604000	In January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for a promotional trailer intended to advertise the animated film Yellow Submarine, loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition.
604001	Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response.
604002	By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating.
604003	The tension grew while recording The Beatles, commonly known as the White Album.
604004	Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: "We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away ... we were always fighting [his] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own". In March 1969, McCartney married Linda Eastman, and in August, the couple had their first child, Mary, named after his late mother.
604005	For Abbey Road, the band's last recorded album, Martin suggested "a continuously moving piece of music", urging the group to think symphonically.
604006	McCartney agreed, but Lennon did not.
604007	They eventually compromised, agreeing to McCartney's suggestion: an LP featuring individual songs on side one, and a long medley on side two.
604008	On 10 April 1970, in the midst of business disagreements with his bandmates, McCartney announced his departure from the group.
604009	He filed suit for the band's formal dissolution on 31 December 1970.
604010	More legal disputes followed as McCartney's attorneys, his in-laws John and Lee Eastman, fought Lennon, Harrison, and Starr's business manager, Allen Klein, over royalties and creative control.
604011	An English court legally dissolved the Beatles on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company EMI, Klein, and each other persisted until 1989.
604012	After the Beatles' break-up in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, McCartney, a US number-one album.
604013	Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with Paul providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals.
604014	In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-co-written US number-one hit single "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings.
604015	McCartney had this to say on the groups's formation: "Wings were always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow [the Beatles'] success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping."
604016	In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.
605000	Following the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham.
605001	Ten more dates followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances.
605002	A seven-week, 25-show tour of Europe followed, during which the band played solely Wings and McCartney solo material with the exception of a few covers, including the Little Richard hit "Long Tall Sally", the only song McCartney played during the tour that had previously been recorded by the Beatles.
605003	McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.
605004	Of his first two post-Beatles tours, McCartney said, "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe."
605005	In March 1973, Wings achieved their first US number-one single, "My Love", included on their second LP, Red Rose Speedway, a US number one and UK top five.
605006	Paul's collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song "Live and Let Die", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name.
605007	Nominated for an Academy Award, the song reached number two in the US and number nine in the UK.
605008	It also earned Martin a Grammy for his orchestral arrangement.
605009	Music professor and author Vincent Benitez described the track as "symphonic rock at its best".
606000	After the departure of McCullough and Seiwell in 1973, the McCartneys and Laine recorded Band on the Run.
606001	The album was the first of seven platinum Wings LPs.
606002	It was a US and UK number one, the band's first to top the charts in both countries and the first ever to reach Billboard magazine's charts on three separate occasions.
606003	One of the best-selling releases of the decade, it remained on the UK charts for 124 weeks.
606004	Rolling Stone named it Album of the Year for 1974, and in 1975 it won Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary/Pop Vocal and Best Engineered Album.
606005	In 1974, Wings achieved a second US number-one single with the title track.
606006	The album also included the top-ten hits "Jet" and "Helen Wheels", and earned the 413th spot on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
606007	Wings followed Band on the Run with the chart-topping albums Venus and Mars (1975) and Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976). In 1975, they began the fourteen-month Wings Over the World Tour, which included stops in the UK, Australia, Europe and the US.
606008	The tour marked the first time McCartney performed Beatles songs live with Wings, with five in the two-hour set list: "I've Just Seen a Face", "Yesterday", "Blackbird", "Lady Madonna" and "The Long and Winding Road". Following the second European leg of the tour and extensive rehearsals in London, the group undertook an ambitious US arena tour that yielded the US number-one live triple LP Wings over America.
606009	In September 1977, the McCartneys had a third child, a son they named James.
606010	In November, the Wings song "Mull of Kintyre", co-written with Laine, was quickly becoming one of the best-selling singles in UK chart history.
606011	The most successful single of McCartney's solo career, it achieved double the sales of the previous record holder, "She Loves You", and went on to sell 2.5 million copies and hold the UK sales record until the 1984 charity single, "Do They Know It's Christmas?".
607000	London Town (1978) spawned a US number-one single ("With a Little Luck"), and was Wings' best-selling LP since Band on the Run, making the top five in both the US and the UK.
607001	Critical reception was unfavourable, and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album.
607002	Back to the Egg (1979) featured McCartney's collaboration with a rock supergroup dubbed "the Rockestra". Credited to Wings, the band included Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, Gary Brooker, John Paul Jones and John Bonham.
607003	Though certified platinum, critics panned Back to the Egg.
607004	Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs "Got to Get You into My Life", "The Fool on the Hill" and "Let it Be". In 1980, McCartney released his second solo LP, the self-produced McCartney II, which peaked at number one in the UK and number three in the US.
607005	As with his first album, he composed and performed it alone.
607006	The album contained the song "Coming Up", the live version of which, recorded in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1979 by Wings, became the group's last number-one hit.
607007	By 1981, McCartney felt he had accomplished all he could creatively with Wings and decided he needed a change.
607008	The group disbanded in April 1981 following disagreements over royalties and salaries.
607009	In 1982 McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martin-produced number-one hit "Ebony and Ivory", included on McCartney's Tug of War LP, and with Michael Jackson on "The Girl Is Mine" from Thriller.
607010	The following year, he and Jackson worked on "Say Say Say", McCartney's most recent US number one as of 2012.
607011	McCartney earned his latest UK number one as of 2012 with the title track of his LP release that year, "Pipes of Peace". In 1984, McCartney starred in the musical Give My Regards to Broad Street, a feature film he also wrote and produced which included Starr in an acting role.
607012	Disparaged by critics, Variety described the film as "characterless, bloodless, and pointless". Roger Ebert awarded it a single star and wrote, "you can safely skip the movie and proceed directly to the soundtrack". The album fared much better, reaching number one in the UK and producing the US top-ten hit single "No More Lonely Nights", featuring David Gilmour on lead guitar.
607013	In 1985, Warner Brothers commissioned McCartney to write a song for the comedic feature film Spies Like Us.
607014	He composed and recorded the track in four days, with Phil Ramone co-producing.
607015	McCartney participated in Live Aid, performing "Let it Be", but technical difficulties rendered his vocals and piano barely audible for the first two verses, punctuated by squeals of feedback.
607016	Equipment technicians resolved the problems and David Bowie, Alison Moyet, Pete Townshend and Bob Geldof joined McCartney on stage, receiving an enthusiastic crowd reaction.
608000	McCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on Press to Play (1986), with Stewart co-writing more than half the songs on the LP.
608001	In 1988, McCartney released Снова в СССР, released only in the Soviet Union, which contained eighteen covers; recorded over the course of two days.
608002	In 1989, he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of "Ferry Cross the Mersey", for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund.
608003	That same year, he released Flowers in the Dirt; a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins.
608004	McCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda, with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars, Paul "Wix" Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums.
608005	In September 1989, they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour, his first in over a decade.
608006	The following year, he released the triple album, Tripping the Live Fantastic, which contained select performances from the tour.
608007	In 1990, the US publication Amusement Business presented McCartney with an award for the highest grossing show of the year; his two performances at Berkeley earned over $3.5 million.
608008	He performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990, when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
608009	McCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial.
608010	He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio.
608011	The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral.
608012	Reviews were negative.
608013	The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as "afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo", and adding that the piece has "little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he stated, "happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work."
608014	The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart, Music Week.
610000	Having witnessed the 11 September 2001 attacks from the JFK airport tarmac, McCartney was inspired to take a leading role in organising the Concert for New York City.
610001	His studio album release in November that year, Driving Rain, included the song "Freedom", written in response to the attacks.
610002	The following year, McCartney went out on tour with a band that included guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, accompanied by Paul "Wix" Wickens on keyboards and Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums.
610003	They began the Driving World Tour in April 2002, which included stops in the US, Mexico and Japan.
610004	The tour resulted in the double live album Back in the U.S., released internationally in 2003 as Back in the World.
610005	The tour earned a reported $126.2 million, an average of over $2 million per night, and Billboard named it the top tour of the year.
610006	In July 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills.
610007	In November, on the first anniversary of George Harrison's death, McCartney performed at the Concert for George.
610008	He participated in the National Football League's Super Bowl, performing "Freedom" during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 and headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.
610009	The English College of Arms honoured McCartney in 2002 by granting him a coat of arms.
610010	His crest, featuring a Liver Bird holding an acoustic guitar in its claw, reflects his background in Liverpool and his musical career.
610011	The shield includes four curved emblems which resemble beetles' backs.
610012	The arms' motto is Ecce Cor Meum, Latin for "Behold My Heart". In 2003, the McCartneys had a child, Beatrice Milly.
610013	In July 2005, he performed at the Live 8 event in Hyde Park, London, opening the show with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (with U2) and closing it with "Drive My Car" (with George Michael), "Helter Skelter", and "The Long and Winding Road". In September, he released the rock album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, for which he provided most of the instrumentation.
610014	In 2006, McCartney released the classical work Ecce Cor Meum.
610015	The rock album Memory Almost Full followed in 2007.
610016	In 2008, he released his third Fireman album, Electric Arguments.
610017	Also in 2008, he performed at a concert in Liverpool to celebrate the city's year as European Capital of Culture.
610018	In 2009, after a four-year break, he returned to touring and has since performed over 80 shows.
610019	More than forty-five years after the Beatles first appeared on American television during The Ed Sullivan Show, he returned to the same New York theatre to perform on Late Show with David Letterman.
610020	On 9 September 2009, EMI reissued the Beatles catalogue following a four-year digital remastering effort, releasing a music video game called The Beatles: Rock Band the same day.
611000	McCartney's enduring fame has made him a popular choice to open new venues.
611001	In 2009, he played three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field-a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York.
611002	These performances yielded the double live album Good Evening New York City later that year.
611003	In 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
611004	In July 2011, McCartney played two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium.
611005	A New York Times review of the first concert reported that McCartney was "not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts."
611006	In September 2011, having been commissioned by the New York City Ballet, McCartney released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called Ocean's Kingdom.
611007	Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell.
611008	He released Kisses on the Bottom, a collection of standards, in February 2012; that same month the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honoured him as the MusiCares Person of the Year, two days prior to his performance at the 54th Grammy Awards.
611009	As of 2013, McCartney remains one of the world's top draws.
611010	He played to over 100,000 people total during two performances in Mexico City in May, the shows grossing nearly $6million.
611011	In June 2012, McCartney closed Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace, performing a set that included "Let It Be" and "Live and Let Die". He closed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 27 July, singing "The End" and "Hey Jude" and inviting the audience to join in on the coda.
611012	Having donated his time, he received £1 from the Olympic organisers.
611013	On 12 December, McCartney performed, supported by Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Pat Smear (all former members of Nirvana), the closing act of 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief, seen by approximately two billion people worldwide.
612000	Largely a self-taught musician, McCartney's approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist-a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". McCartney commented, "I prefer to think of my approach to music as ... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training."
612001	McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC.
612002	Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle.
612003	He does not use slapping or muting techniques.
612004	He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, who McCartney called a hero for his melodic style.
612005	He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: "because he went to very unusual places". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.
612006	During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording.
612007	While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification.
612008	During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.
612009	He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason.
612010	He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.
612011	MacDonald identified "She's a Woman" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on "The Word". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track "a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument."
612012	MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he "delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date".
613000	Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song "Rain" as "an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove."
613001	MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best B-B-side, stating that its "clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [bassline]", which MacDonald described as "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track". MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in "exotic melismas in the bass part". McCartney identified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". McCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking.
613002	Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include "Yesterday", "I'm Looking Through You", "Michelle", "Blackbird", "I Will", "Mother Nature's Son" and "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out "Blackbird" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: "I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time ... I was trying to emulate those folk players."
613003	He employed a similar technique for "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.
613004	McCartney played lead electric guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "Drive My Car", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino.
613005	McCartney said of the instrument, "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."
613006	He contributed what MacDonald described as "a startling guitar solo" on the Harrison composition "Taxman" and the "shrieking" guitar on "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Helter Skelter". MacDonald also praised McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian" guitar solo on "Good Morning Good Morning". McCartney also played lead guitar on "Another Girl". On his "Taxman" solo, McCartney commented, "I was very inspired by Jimi Hendrix. It was really my first voyage into feedback."
613007	In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, "but I still like Hendrix the best."
613008	He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.
614000	McCartney's vocals cross several musical genres.
614001	On "Call Me Back Again", according to Benitez, "McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist" while MacDonald called "I'm Down" "a rock-and-roll classic" that "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility". MacDonald described "Helter Skelter" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and "Hey Jude" as a "pop/rock hybrid", pointing out McCartney's "use of gospel-style melismas" in the song and his "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out". Benitez identified "Hope of Deliverance" and "Put It There" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "Honey Pie" attempts at vaudeville.
614002	MacDonald praised the "swinging beat" of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, "She's a Woman" as "the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice "at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment."
614003	MacDonald described "I've Got a Feeling" as a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" vocal performance and "Back in the U.S.S.R." as "the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's "belting" vocals among his best since "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier.
614004	McCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including "Every Little Thing", "She's a Woman", "For No One", "A Day in the Life", "Hello, Goodbye", "Hey Jude", "Lady Madonna", "Let It Be" and "The Long and Winding Road". MacDonald considered the piano part in "Lady Madonna" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and "Let It Be" as having a gospel rhythm.
614005	MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on "Strawberry Fields Forever" an integral feature of the song's character.
614006	McCartney played a Moog synthesizer on the Beatles song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and the Wings track "Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)". Ingham described the Wings songs "With a Little Luck" and "London Town" as "full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches".
615000	McCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs "Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Dear Prudence", "Martha My Dear", "Wild Honey Pie" and "The Ballad of John and Yoko". He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo albums McCartney and McCartney II, as well as on the Wings album Band on the Run and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.
615001	In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home.
615002	They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him.
615003	Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops.
615004	He referred to the finished product as "electronic symphonies". He reversed the tapes, and speeded them up and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs "Tomorrow Never Knows" and "The Fool on the Hill". McCartney's earliest musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry.
615005	When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the Sgt. Pepper cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King."
615006	McCartney stated that for his bassline for "I Saw Her Standing There", he directly quoted Berry's "I'm Talking About You". McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalizations inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.
615007	McCartney said he wrote "I'm Down" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.
615008	In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly Week" in England.
615009	The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.
616000	While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work.
616001	However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college.
616002	During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances.
616003	His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser.
616004	At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton.
616005	McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, using his painting of an apple for the Apple Records logo.
616006	McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono.
616007	Miles also co-founded International Times, an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income.
616008	Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years From Now (1997). McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio.
616009	McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999.
616010	The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie.
616011	Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art.
616012	In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England.
616013	In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool.
616014	McCartney said, "I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.
617000	When McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books.
617001	His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, so as to increase their "word power", as McCartney said.
617002	In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City.
617003	In the foreword of the book, he explains: "When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful-which was promptly rejected-and I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since". In 2005, he released High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail, a collaboration with author Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar that The Guardian labelled an "anti-capitalist children's book". In 1981, McCartney asked Geoff Dunbar to direct a short animated film called Rupert and the Frog Song; McCartney was the writer and producer, and he also added some of the character voices.
617004	In 1992, he worked with Dunbar on an animated film about the work of French artist Honoré Daumier, which won them a BAFTA award.
617005	In 2004, they worked together on the animated short film Tropic Island Hum.
617006	The accompanying single, "Tropic Island Hum"/"We All Stand Together", reached number 21 in the UK.
617007	McCartney also produced and hosted The Real Buddy Holly Story, a 1985 documentary featuring interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, the Holly family, and others.
617008	In 1995, he made a guest appearance on the Simpsons episode "Lisa the Vegetarian" and directed a short documentary about the Grateful Dead.
617009	McCartney is one of the UK's wealthiest people, with an estimated fortune of £475 million in 2010.
617010	In addition to an interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, an umbrella company for his business interests, he owns a significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, Annie and Grease.
617011	He earned £40 million in 2003, the highest income that year within media professions in the UK.
617012	This rose to £48.5 million by 2005.
618000	McCartney's music has appeared on several record labels.
618001	In January 1962, Polydor Records issued the first commercially released recording of the Beatles, a single called "My Bonnie". Credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers, Decca Records issued the track in the UK in April 1962.
618002	The following year, Parlophone released the band's singles "Please Please Me"/"Ask Me Why" and "From Me to You"/"Thank You Girl" in the UK.
618003	Vee-Jay Records released them in the US.
618004	Also that year, Swan Records released the group's UK Parlophone single "She Loves You"/"I'll Get You" in the US.
618005	From then until July 1968, EMI's Capitol (US) and Parlophone (UK) labels released the band's music.
618006	Starting with the August 1968 release "Hey Jude"/"Revolution", their new material would be issued with Apple labels, logos and sleeves, but with Parlophone or Capitol serial numbers.
618007	Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976.
618008	Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US and Canada.
618009	In 1979, McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canada reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world.
618010	McCartney returned to Capitol in 1985 and from 1985 until 2006, Parlophone released McCartney's music in the UK and Capitol in the US.
618011	In 2007, McCartney signed with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist.
618012	He remains there as of 2012's Kisses on the Bottom.
618013	In 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of Lennon-McCartney.
618014	McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965.
618015	In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973.
618016	In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and McCartney Music.
618017	Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.
618018	McCartney and Yoko Ono attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman Robert Holmes à Court.
618019	Michael Jackson subsequently purchased ATV in 1985.
618020	In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95 million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership.
618021	McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years.
618022	Now formally dissolved, in 1995 it became absorbed in the Sony/ATV catalogue.
618023	McCartney receives writers' royalties which together are 33⅓ percent of total commercial proceeds in the US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent.
618024	Two of the Beatles' earliest songs-"Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You"-were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before signing with James.
618025	McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by MPL Communications.
629000	John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 - 8 December 1980) was an English musician, singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the Beatles, one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music.
629001	With Paul McCartney, he formed one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.
629002	Born and raised in Liverpool, as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze; his first band, the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960.
629003	As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as "Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine". After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon.
629004	Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to raising his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy.
629005	He was murdered three weeks after its release.
629006	Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.
629007	Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved to New York City in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon's administration to deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement.
629008	As of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceed 14 million units, and as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart.
629009	In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth, and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time.
629010	He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.
63000	Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder.
630000	Lennon was born in war-time England, on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (née Stanley) and Alfred Lennon, a merchant seaman who was away at the time of his son's birth.
630001	His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John "Jack" Lennon, and then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
630002	His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother, but the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944.
630003	When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia-by then pregnant with another man's child-rejected the idea.
630004	After her sister, Mimi Smith, twice complained to Liverpool's Social Services, Julia handed the care of Lennon over to her.
630005	In July 1946 Lennon's father visited Smith and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.
630006	Julia followed them-with her partner at the time, 'Bobby' Dykins-and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them.
630007	Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.
630008	It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.
630009	Throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his aunt and uncle, Mimi and George Smith, who had no children of their own, at Mendips, 251 Menlove Avenue, Woolton.
63001	Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary."
630010	His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving crossword puzzles.
630011	Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when he was 11 years old he often visited her at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him Elvis Presley records, and taught him the banjo, learning how to play "Ain't That a Shame" by Fats Domino.
63002	The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days, and took a supporting role in the HBO television movie The Image.
63003	His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Ricky Schroder.
63004	After years of supporting roles in movies and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in the 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.
63005	He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.
63006	After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 film Cool World, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.
63007	Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.
63008	His portrayal of the character has been described as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk."
63009	He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his "weakest performances... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for."
63010	Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew.
63011	He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."
631000	In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature: Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician. But I cannot be what I am not ... I was the one who all the other boys' parents-including Paul's father-would say, 'Keep away from him'... The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker, meaning I did not conform and I would influence their children, which I did. I did my best to disrupt every friend's home ... Partly out of envy that I didn't have this so-called home ... but I did... There were five women that were my family. Five strong, intelligent, beautiful women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn't deal with life. She was the youngest and she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me, and I ended up living with her elder sister. Now those women were fantastic ... And that was my first feminist education ... I would infiltrate the other boys minds. I could say, "Parents are not gods because I don't live with mine and, therefore, I know.'
631001	He regularly visited his cousin, Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood.
631002	Seven years Lennon's senior, Parkes took him on trips and to local cinemas.
631003	During the school holidays, Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, often travelling to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows.
631004	They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby.
631005	After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there.
631006	Parkes recalled, "John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16."
631007	He was 14 years old when his uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955 (aged 52).
632000	Lennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School.
632001	From September 1952 to 1957, after passing his Eleven-Plus exam, he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool, and was described by Harvey at the time as, "A happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad."
632002	He often drew comical cartoons which appeared in his own self-made school magazine called The Daily Howl, but despite his artistic talent, his school reports were damning: "Certainly on the road to failure ... hopeless ... rather a clown in class ... wasting other pupils' time."
632003	His mother bought him his first guitar in 1956, an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which she "lent" her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house, and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations.
632004	As Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, she hoped he would grow bored with music, often telling him, "The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it". On 15 July 1958, when Lennon was 17 years old, his mother, walking home after visiting the Smiths' house, was struck by a car and killed.
632005	Lennon failed all his GCE O-level examinations, and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art only after his aunt and headmaster intervened.
632006	Once at the college, he started wearing Teddy Boy clothes and acquired a reputation for disrupting classes and ridiculing teachers.
632007	As a result, he was excluded from the painting class, then the graphic arts course, and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour, which included sitting on a nude model's lap during a life drawing class.
632008	He failed an annual exam, despite help from fellow student and future wife Cynthia Powell, and was "thrown out of the college before his final year."
642000	Ono issued a statement the next day, saying "There is no funeral for John", ending it with the words, "John loved and prayed for the human race. Please pray the same for him."
642001	His body was cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.
642002	Ono scattered his ashes in New York's Central Park, where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created.
642003	Chapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life.
642004	As of 2013, he remains in prison, having been denied parole seven times.
642005	Lennon and Cynthia Powell met in 1957 as fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art.
642006	Although being scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde.
642007	Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?"
642008	She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend at the time to visit him.
642009	Lennon, jealous by nature, eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence.
642010	Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude to women.
642011	The Beatles' song "Getting Better", he said, told his own story, "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically-any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace". Recalling his reaction in July 1962 on learning that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, "There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married."
642012	The couple were married on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool.
642013	His marriage began just as Beatlemania took hold across the UK.
642014	He performed on the evening of his wedding day, and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.
642015	Epstein, fearing that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret.
642016	Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his son until three days later.
643000	Cynthia attributes the start of the marriage breakdown to LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her.
643001	When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales, in 1967, for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding.
643002	She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the ending of their marriage.
643003	After arriving home at Kenwood, and finding Lennon with Ono, Cynthia left the house to stay with friends.
643004	Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him.
643005	After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to her divorcing him on the same grounds.
643006	The case was settled out of court, with Lennon giving her £100,000 and custody of Julian.
643007	The Beatles were performing at Liverpool's Cavern Club in 1962, when they were introduced to Epstein after a midday concert.
643008	Epstein was homosexual.
643009	According to biographer Philip Norman, one of his reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was physically attracted to Lennon.
643010	Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship.
643011	Questioned about it later, Lennon said, "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this."
643012	Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club MC Bob Wooler for saying "How was your honeymoon, John?"
643013	The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the honeymoon, deferred, was still two months in the future.
643014	To Lennon, who was intoxicated with alcohol at the time, the matter was simple: "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".
644000	Lennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish.
644001	When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered Queer Jew; on learning of the eventual title, A Cellarful of Noise, he parodied, "More like A Cellarful of Boys". He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, "Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't."
644002	During the recording of "Baby, You're a Rich Man", he sang altered choruses of "Baby, you're a rich fag Jew". Lennon's first son, Julian, was born as his commitments with the Beatles intensified at the height of Beatlemania during his marriage to Cynthia.
644003	Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963.
644004	Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced public knowledge of such things would threaten The Beatles' commercial success.
644005	Julian recalls how some four years later, as a small child in Weybridge, "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'"
644006	Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles' song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, "It's not an acid song."
644007	McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name.
644008	Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father.
644009	During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, "Hey Jules", to comfort him.
644010	It would evolve into The Beatles song "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't."
645000	Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono's 1971 move to New York, Julian would not see his father again until 1973.
645001	With Pang's encouragement, it was arranged for him (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland.
645002	Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track.
645003	He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.
645004	Julian recalls that he and his father "got on a great deal better" during the time he spent in New York: "We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general."
645005	In a Playboy interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, "Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will."
645006	He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, "Julian and I will have a relationship in the future."
645007	After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.
645008	Two versions exist of how Lennon met Ono.
645009	According to the first, told by the Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar.
645010	Lennon was intrigued by Ono's "Hammer A Nail": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece.
645011	Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him.
645012	Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it."
645013	Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."
645014	The second version, told by McCartney, is that in late 1965, Ono was in London compiling original musical scores for a book John Cage was working on, Notations, but McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts for the book, suggesting that Lennon might oblige.
645015	When asked, Lennon gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "The Word".
646000	Ono began telephoning and calling at Lennon's home, and when his wife asked for an explanation, he explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her "avant-garde bullshit". In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit.
646001	They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they "made love at dawn."
646002	When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, "Oh, hi."
646003	Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child they named John Ono Lennon II on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.
646004	During Lennon's last two years in the Beatles, he and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War.
646005	They were married at The Rock Hotel in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for peace.
646006	They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry, so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded "Give Peace a Chance". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their "Bagism", first introduced during a Vienna press conference.
646007	Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song "The Ballad of John and Yoko". Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding "Ono" as a middle name.
646008	The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building, made famous three months earlier by The Beatles' Let It Be rooftop concert.
646009	Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.
646010	The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire.
646011	After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, Abbey Road.
646012	To escape the acrimony of the band's break-up, Ono suggested they move permanently to New York, which they did on 31 August 1971.
647000	They first lived in the St. Regis Hotel on 5th Avenue, East 55th Street, then moved to a street-level flat at 105 Bank Street, Greenwich Village, on 16 October 1971.
647001	After a robbery, they relocated to the more secure Dakota at 1 West 72nd Street, in May 1973.
647002	ABKCO Industries, formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records, recruited May Pang as a receptionist in 1969.
647003	Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year.
647004	She became their personal assistant.
647005	After she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged from one another.
647006	She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, "He likes you a lot."
647007	Pang, 22, astounded by Ono's proposition, eventually agreed to become Lennon's companion.
647008	The pair soon moved to California, beginning an 18-month period he later called his "lost weekend". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years.
647009	He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles' roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson.
647010	Whilst drinking with Nilsson, after misunderstanding something Pang said, Lennon attempted to strangle her, relenting only when physically restrained by Nilsson.
647011	On moving to New York, they prepared a spare room in their newly rented apartment for Julian to visit.
647012	Lennon, hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.
647013	By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he was refusing to accept Ono's telephone calls.
647014	In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono-who said she had found a cure for smoking.
647015	But after the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang.
647016	When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, being exhausted after a hypnotherapy session.
647017	Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment, stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.
647018	He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.
648000	When Lennon and Ono were reunited, she became pregnant, but having previously suffered three miscarriages in her attempt to have a child with Lennon, she said she wanted an abortion.
648001	She agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband; this he agreed to do.
648002	Sean was born on 9 October 1975, Lennon's 35th birthday, delivered by Caesarean section.
648003	Lennon's subsequent career break would span five years.
648004	He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year, and created numerous drawings for him, posthumously published as Real Love: The Drawings for Sean.
648005	Lennon later proudly declared, "He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish."
648006	Although his friendship with Starr remained consistently friendly during the years following the Beatles' break-up in 1970, Lennon's relationship with McCartney and Harrison varied.
648007	He was close to Harrison initially, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to America.
648008	When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. (
648009	Lennon eventually signed the papers while holidaying in Florida with Pang and Julian.)
648010	Harrison incensed Lennon in 1980, when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.
648011	Lennon told Playboy, "I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book."
648012	Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney.
648013	In addition to attacking him through the lyrics of "How Do You Sleep?",
648014	Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split.
648015	The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more.
648016	Lennon said that during McCartney's final visit, in April 1976, they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.
648017	Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: "Throughout my career, I've selected to work with ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ... That ain't bad picking."
649000	Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music.
649001	During his five-year career break he was content to sit back so long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.
649002	When McCartney released, "Coming Up", in 1980, the year Lennon returned to the studio and the last year of his life, he took notice. "
649003	It's driving me crackers!" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.
649004	Asked the same year whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.
649005	But he also said, "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on."
649006	Lennon and Ono used their honeymoon as what they termed a "Bed-In for Peace" at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel; the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule.
649007	At a second Bed-In three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal Lennon wrote and recorded "Give Peace a Chance". Released as a single, it was quickly taken up as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the Vietnam War in Washington, DC, on 15 November, the second Vietnam Moratorium Day.
649008	In December, they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, "War Is Over! If You Want It". Later that year, Lennon and Ono supported efforts by the family of James Hanratty, hanged for murder in 1962, to prove his innocence.
649009	Those who had condemned Hanratty were, according to Lennon, "the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets. ... The same bastards are in control, the same people are running everything, it's the whole bullshit bourgeois scene."
649010	In London, Lennon and Ono staged a "Britain Murdered Hanratty" banner march and a "Silent Protest For James Hanratty", and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case.
649011	At an appeal hearing years later, Hanratty's conviction was upheld after DNA evidence matched.
649012	His family continued to appeal in 2010.
650000	Lennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the Clydeside UCS workers' work-in of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for £5,000.
650001	On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the Chicago Seven, Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman.
650002	Another political activist, John Sinclair, poet and co-founder of the White Panther Party, was serving ten years in prison for selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug.
650003	In December 1971 at Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15,000 people attended the "John Sinclair Freedom Rally", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, and others.
650004	Lennon and Ono, backed by David Peel and Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming Some Time in New York City album including "John Sinclair", whose lyrics called for his release.
650005	The day before the rally, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond.
650006	The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on John Lennon Anthology (1998). Following the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, in which 14 unarmed civil rights protesters were shot dead by the British Army, Lennon said that given the choice between the army and the IRA (who were not involved in the incident) he would side with the latter.
650007	Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their Some Time in New York City album: "Luck of the Irish" and "Sunday Bloody Sunday". In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's domestic security service MI5 suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA though this was swiftly denied by Ono.
650008	Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film The Irish Tapes, a political documentary with a Republican slant.
651000	According to FBI surveillance reports (and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006) Lennon was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group, a Trotskyist group formed in Britain in 1968.
651001	However, the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary since he was "constantly under the influence of narcotics". In 1973, Lennon contributed a limerick called "Why Make It Sad To Be Gay?" to Len Richmond's The Gay Liberation Book.
651002	Lennon's last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980.
651003	He and Ono planned to join the workers' protest on 14 December.
651004	Following the impact of "Give Peace a Chance" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", both strongly associated with the anti-Vietnam War movement, the Nixon administration, hearing rumours of Lennon's involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the Republican National Convention, tried to have him deported.
651005	Nixon believed that Lennon's anti-war activities could cost him his re-election; Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that "deportation would be a strategic counter-measure" against Lennon.
651006	The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that his 1968 misdemeanor conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States.
651007	Lennon spent the next three and a half years in and out of deportation hearings until on 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating "... the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds."
651008	While the legal battle continued, Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances.
651009	Lennon and Ono co-hosted the Mike Douglas Show for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to mid-America.
651010	In 1972, Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon, stating:
652000	John and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country's so-called art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing that, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!
652001	On 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days.
652002	Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence.
652003	In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with "no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US.
652004	The press conference was filmed, and would later appear in the 2006 documentary The U.S. vs. John Lennon.
652005	Lennon's Mind Games (1973) included the track "Nutopian International Anthem", which comprised three seconds of silence.
652006	Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, DC.
652007	They led to the president's resignation 14 months later.
652008	Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975.
652009	The following year, his US immigration status finally resolved, Lennon received his "green card" certifying his permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.
652010	After Lennon's death, historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files documenting the Bureau's role in the deportation attempt.
652011	The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information.
652012	In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
652013	It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.
652014	The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991.
652015	The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.
652016	In 1997, respecting President Bill Clinton's newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve "foreseeable harm", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.
652017	Wiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000.
652018	Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files contained facsimiles of the documents, including "lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges". The story is told in the documentary The U.S. vs. John Lennon.
652019	The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing "national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality", were released in December 2006.
652020	They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.
653000	Beatles' biographer Bill Harry writes that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle.
653001	He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl.
653002	The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay.
653003	According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen band mate, Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it.
653004	Turner said that Lennon "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, "the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier."
653005	Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog-also wearing glasses". Lennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24.
653006	Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after "Some journalist who was hanging around The Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings.
653007	One story, "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail-until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories "remarkable ... also very funny ... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge."
653008	Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".
654000	In combination with A Spaniard in the Works (1965), In His Own Write formed the basis of the stage play The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write, co-adapted by Victor Spinetti and Adrienne Kennedy.
654001	After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the National Theatre, Sir Laurence Olivier, the play opened at the Old Vic in 1968.
654002	Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together to date.
654003	After Lennon's death, further works were published, including Skywriting by Word of Mouth (1986); Ai: Japan Through John Lennon's Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook (1992), with Lennon's illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words; and Real Love: The Drawings for Sean (1999). The Beatles Anthology (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.
654004	Lennon's playing of a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland caught the driver's ear.
654005	Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus.
654006	The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy.
654007	He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings.
654008	His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar.
654009	At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.
654010	As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior.
654011	Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, (Back in the USSR), providing bass on some Beatles' numbers (The Long and Winding Road or Helter Skelter) that occupied McCartney with another instrument.
654012	His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including "Imagine", described as his best-known solo work.
654013	His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, "I Want to Hold Your Hand". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles' recording until "Strawberry Fields Forever" in late 1966.
655000	When the Beatles recorded "Twist and Shout", the final track during the mammoth one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out.
655001	Lennon said, "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming."
655002	In the words of biographer Barry Miles, "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll."
655003	The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice! ... put something on it ... Make it different.'"
655004	Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.
655005	Music critic Robert Christgau says that Lennon's "greatest vocal performance ... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically ... echoed, filtered, and double tracked."
655006	As his Beatles' era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression.
655007	Biographer Chris Gregory writes that Lennon was, "tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of "Cold Turkey" and the cathartic John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band."
655008	David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from, "extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety" to a hard "rasping" style.
655009	Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be "at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair" Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' Ed Sullivan Show performance of "This Boy" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: "As Lennon's vocals reached their peak ... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had."
656000	Music historians Schinder and Schwartz, writing of the transformation in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s, say that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having "revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts", the group then "spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers". Liam Gallagher, his group Oasis among the many who acknowledge the band's influence, identifies Lennon as a hero; in 1999 he named his first child Lennon Gallagher in tribute.
656001	On National Poetry Day in 1999, after conducting a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric, the BBC announced "Imagine" the winner.
656002	In a 2006 Guardian article, Jon Wiener wrote: "For young people in 1972, it was thrilling to see Lennon's courage in standing up to [US President] Nixon. That willingness to take risks with his career, and his life, is one reason why people still admire him today."
656003	For music historians Urish and Bielen, Lennon's most significant effort was "the self-portraits ... in his songs [which] spoke to, for, and about, the human condition."
656004	Lennon continues to be mourned throughout the world and has been the subject of numerous memorials and tributes.
656005	In 2002, the airport in Lennon's home town was renamed the Liverpool John Lennon Airport.
656006	In 2010, on what would have been Lennon's 70th birthday, the John Lennon Peace Monument was unveiled in Chavasse Park, Liverpool, by Cynthia and Julian Lennon.
656007	The sculpture entitled 'Peace & Harmony' exhibits peace symbols and carries the inscription "Peace on Earth for the Conservation of Life - In Honour of John Lennon 1940-1980".
672000	E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.
672001	With six number one albums, Carey is tied with Britney Spears and Janet Jackson in the United States for the third most number one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with seven and Barbra Streisand's nine chart toppers. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked her at number six on the "Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists", making Carey the second most successful female artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
672002	Carey and actor/comedian Nick Cannon met while they shot her music video for her second single, "Bye Bye", on an island off the coast of Antigua.
672003	On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon at her private estate on Windermere Island in The Bahamas.
672004	Carey had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's 2008 film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.
672005	Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC², describing its production and direction in several interviews.
672006	When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough."
672007	Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.
672008	Heavy speculation suggested that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles.
672009	Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight.
672010	Carey did not address those allegations until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage.
672011	For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.
673000	On January 20, 2009, Carey performed "Hero" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.
673001	On July 7, 2009, Carey - alongside Trey Lorenz - performed her version of The Jackson 5 song "I'll Be There" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.
673002	At the sight of Jackson's casket, Carey's voice, overwhelmed with emotion, cracked in the opening line of the song.
673003	She later apologized on The Today Show, explaining how she did her best effort despite the circumstances.
673004	In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in Precious, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire.
673005	The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, as had Carey's performance.
673006	Variety described her acting as "pitch-perfect". Precious won awards at both the Sundance Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival, receiving top honors there.
673007	In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in Precious at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
673008	On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, was released.
673009	Reception for the album was generally positive, but mixed in certain aspects; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it "her most interesting album in a decade", while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times criticized Carey's vocal performances, decrying her overuse of her softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers.
673010	Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and became the lowest-selling studio album of her career.
673011	The album's lead single, "Obsessed", became her 40th entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and her highest debut on the chart since "My All" in 1998.
673012	The song debuted at number eleven and peaked at number seven on the chart, and became Carey's 27th US top-ten hit, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson as the fifth most top-ten hits.
673013	Within hours after the song's release, various outlets speculated that its target was rapper Eminem, in response to his song "Bagpipes from Baghdad", in which he taunted Carey's husband, Nick Cannon.
673014	According to MTV, Carey alludes to drug problems in "Obsessed", which Eminem opened up about on his sixth studio album, Relapse.
673015	The album's follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's "I Want to Know What Love Is", failed to achieve any significant chart success in the United States, or much throughout Europe, but managed to break airplay records in Brazil.
673016	The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100 Airplay, making it the longest running song in the chart's history.
673017	On December 31, 2009, Carey embarked her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada.
673018	Though stateside, the tour spanned few international dates, such as in Brazil and Singapore, where Carey played to over 100,000 spectators.
673019	The tour ended on September 26, 2010.
673020	On January 30, 2010, it was announced that Carey would release a remix album of Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel; titled Angels Advocate (an R&B remix album featuring a collection of newly remixed duets with some of Carey's favorite artists). The album was slated for a March 30, 2010 release, but was eventually cancelled.
674000	Following the cancellation of Angels Advocate, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album.
674001	It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, the follow-up to Merry Christmas (1994), which became the best-selling Holiday album of all time.
674002	Longtime collaborators for the project included Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin, Bryan-Michael Cox and Randy Jackson, as well as new collaborators such as Marc Shaiman.
674003	Dupri stated that a single would be released alongside the album before the year's end.
674004	During a press conference in Seoul, South Korea in August 2010, Island Def Jam executive Matt Voss announced that the album would be out on November 2, 2010, and would include six new songs as well as a remix of her classic hit "All I Want for Christmas Is You". The album, titled Merry Christmas II You, was released alongside an accompanying DVD, and was sent to retailers on November 2, 2010.
674005	Merry Christmas II You debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, surpassing the opening week sales of Carey's previous holiday album of 45,000 copies 16 years prior.
674006	It also became Carey's 16th top ten album in the United States.
674007	The album debuted at number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart.
674008	In May 2010, Carey dropped out of her planned appearance in For Colored Girls, the film adaptation of the play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, citing medical reasons.
674009	After much media speculation, Carey confirmed on October 28, 2010, that she and Cannon were expecting their first child.
674010	On February 11, 2011, Carey announced on HSN, that she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his Duets II album, titled "When Do The Bells Ring For Me". In March 2011, it was announced that Carey wrote a song titled "Save the Day" for her upcoming fourteenth studio album.
674011	On April 30, 2011, the couple's third wedding anniversary, Carey gave birth to fraternal twins via C-section.
674012	The twins were named Monroe, after Marilyn Monroe, and Moroccan Scott, after the location in which Cannon proposed to Carey in her Moroccan-style room; Scott is Cannon's middle name and his grandmother's maiden name.
674013	In an interview, Carey stated that her pregnancy was very difficult; she suffered from high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
674014	Before giving birth to the twins, she also said: "I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to walk properly again, It was a huge strain. I would sit and then someone would have to help me up. I couldn't go even to the loo by myself. It was just like, 'What are we doing? Are we going to the hospital?' No, I'm gonna stick it out, I'm gonna keep taking this medicine to keep these babies in... I made it to 35 weeks and then the doctor said it wasn't safe anymore".
675000	Following the birth of their children, Cannon revealed during an interview with Billboard that Carey had already begun working on a new record and that she's been inspired by her first two albums.
675001	Cannon said "She's been working away, and we have a studio in the crib, and [the pregnancy] has totally inspired her on so many different levels. You're definitely gonna see some new phenomenal music from Mariah" and assured Carey would plan on releasing a brand new single by the end of 2011.
675002	When asked if an album will be released by the end of 2011 as well, Cannon said that he was not sure.
675003	However, a late 2011 release for a single never materialized.
675004	In October 2011, Carey announced that she re-recorded her song "All I Want for Christmas Is You" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.
675005	On November 5, 2011, Carey and Bieber filmed a music video for the duet at the Macy's in New York City.
675006	On October 21, 2011, a pre-taped interview with Barbara Walters aired on ABC's 20/20, during the interview Carey and Cannon allowed the cameras to photograph/film twins Moroccan and Monroe for the first time.
675007	In November 2011, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single "Warning" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy.
675008	That same month, Carey announced that she and John Legend collaborated on a duet, "When Christmas Comes", which was originally part of Carey's 2010 holiday album Merry Christmas II You.
675009	On March 1, 2012, Carey took the stage at New York City's Gotham Hall for a show, where only 50 tickets were made available to the public, as part of the Plot Your Escape concert series.
675010	This was Carey's first time performing since giving birth to twins Moroccan and Monroe.
675011	The 40-minute set included many of Carey's hits such as "Always Be My Baby", "Hero", "Obsessed", "We Belong Together", and a cover of Michael Jackson's "I'll Be There". In May 2012, Carey announced that she wrote and recorded a new song titled "Mesmerized" for Lee Daniels's 2012 movie The Paperboy.
675012	On June 14, 2012, Carey performed a three song set at a special fundraiser for United States President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel.
675013	The three songs she performed were "Hero", "We Belong Together", and a new song titled "Bring It On Home", which Carey wrote specifically for the event to show her support behind Obama's re-election campaign.
675014	In June 2012, Carey posted a photo that wrote, "MC Summer 2012", after the photo was posted, many fans speculated that new music will be released soon.
675015	On July 21, 2012, Carey announced that a song titled "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" featuring Rick Ross and Meek Mill, would be released in early August 2012 as the lead single from her fourteenth studio album.
675016	The song was co-written and co-produced by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, and Bryan-Michael Cox.
675017	Walt Disney Studios revealed that Mariah Carey recorded a song called "Almost Home" co-written and co-produced by Carey herself along with Simone Porter, Justin Gray, Lindsey Ray, Tor Erik Hermansen, and Mikkel Eriksen (a.k.a. Stargate) for the soundtrack of the film Oz the Great and Powerful.
675018	The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle.
676000	On July 23, 2012, it was officially announced that Carey would be joining the judging panel of American Idol for season twelve.
676001	Her salary is reported to be $18 million.
676002	It was also announced that Carey will star in Lee Daniels' upcoming 2013 film The Butler, which is about a White House butler who served eight American Presidents over the course of three decades.
676003	The film also stars Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Robin Williams, Melissa Leo, James Marsden, Minka Kelly, Liev Schreiber, John Cusack, Alan Rickman, and Jane Fonda.
676004	Carey said about her fourteenth studio album: "I'm collaborating with a lot of my favorite people but the main thing is [that] I'm not trying to follow any particular trend, I want it to be well received. I want to stay true to myself and the music that I love and make the fans happy". Some of the people that Carey worked with on the album include: DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Loris Holland, Stevie J, James Fauntleroy, Ray Angry, Walter Afanasieff, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, James "Big Jim" Wright, Hit-Boy, The-Dream, Da Brat, and Rodney Jerkins.
676005	Carey gave Billboard magazine an exclusive interview in their March 9, 2013 issue, stating: "It's about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing....There are alot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.....Wherever we go with this project, I've tried to keep the soul and heart in it"; the album was delayed to May 2013.
676006	In late March 2013, Carey stated that she "has more than enough songs" but "she's in the process of finishing things and mixing and all that". The lead single is titled "#Beautiful" and it features singer Miguel.
676007	The song was made available for purchase via iTunes stores worldwide on May 6, 2013.
676008	It officially impacted U.S. Mainstream & Rhythmic radio on May 7, 2013.
676009	The music video was premiered on American Idol on May 9, 2013.
676010	Carey taped a performance of "Beautiful" along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013; the taping aired on the American Idol finale the following day.
676011	She is also set to perform on Good Morning America's Summer Concert Series on May 24, 2013.
688000	Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, music producer, artist, and writer.
688001	He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades.
688002	Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest.
688003	A number of Dylan's early songs, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements.
688004	Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965.
688005	His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.
688006	Dylan's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences.
688007	They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture.
688008	Initially inspired by the performance style of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres.
688009	His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored many of the traditions in American song-from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.
688010	Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica.
688011	Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.
688012	His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.
688013	Since 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.
688014	As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame.
688015	The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power."
688016	In May 2000, Dylan was awarded the Polar Music Prize.
688017	In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.
689000	Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior.
689001	His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.
689002	His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.
689003	In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from Kağızman in north eastern Turkey.
689004	Dylan's parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community.
689005	Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father was stricken with polio and the family returned to his mother's home town, Hibbing, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood.
689006	Robert Zimmerman spent his early years listening to the radio-first to blues and country stations broadcasting from Shreveport, Louisiana, and, as a teen, to early rock and roll.
689007	Zimmerman formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School.
689008	In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard and Elvis Presley.
689009	Their performance of Danny and the Juniors' "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.
689010	In 1959, his high school yearbook carried the caption: "Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'." The same year, using the name Elston Gunnn [sic], he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and providing handclaps.
689011	Zimmerman moved to Minneapolis in September 1959, where he enrolled at the University of Minnesota.
689012	His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music; in 1985, Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him:
690000	The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.
690001	He soon began to perform at the Ten O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local Dinkytown folk music circuit.
690002	During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan". In his autobiography, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas.[
690003	a 1] Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."
690004	Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year (May 1960). In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie, who was seriously ill with Huntington's Disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.
690005	Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances.
690006	Describing Guthrie's impact on him, Dylan later wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple."
690007	As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte Ramblin' Jack Elliott.
690008	Much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles (2004).
691000	From February 1961, Dylan played at various clubs around Greenwich Village.
691001	He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene, including Dave Van Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers, and Irish musicians Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers.
691002	In September, Dylan gained some public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a positive review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde's Folk City.
691003	The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's eponymous third album, which brought his talents to the attention of the album's producer, John Hammond.
691004	Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October.
691005	The performances on his first Columbia album, Bob Dylan, released in March 1962, consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel material combined with two original compositions.
691006	The album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.
691007	Within Columbia Records, some referred to the singer as "Hammond's Folly" and suggested dropping his contract.
691008	Hammond defended Dylan vigorously.
691009	In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and back-up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen, accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records.
691010	While working for Columbia, Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, for Broadside Magazine, a folk music magazine and record label.
691011	Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on the 1964 anthology album, The Blues Project, issued by Elektra Records.
691012	Under the pseudonym Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan contributed harmonica to Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1964 album Jack Elliott.
691013	Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962.
691014	He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.
691015	Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.
691016	Dylan subsequently said of Grossman, "He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming."
691017	Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan's second album by the young African American jazz producer Tom Wilson.
692000	From December 1962 to January 1963, Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom.
692001	He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, The Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television.
692002	At the end of the play, Dylan performed "Blowin' in the Wind", one of the first major public performances of the song.
692003	The film recording of The Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968.
692004	While in London, Dylan performed at several London folk clubs, including The Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.
692005	He also learned new material from several UK performers, including Martin Carthy.
692006	By the time Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, was released in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter.
692007	Many of the songs on this album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's passion for topical songs. "
692008	Oxford Town", for example, was a sardonic account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi.
692009	His most famous song at this time, "Blowin' in the Wind", partially derived its melody from the traditional slave song "No More Auction Block", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.
692010	The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan's songs. "
692011	A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" was based on the tune of the folk ballad "Lord Randall". With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse, it gained even more resonance when the Cuban missile crisis developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.
692012	Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with a traditional folk form.
693000	While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, Freewheelin' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues.
693001	Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona, and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including The Beatles.
693002	George Harrison said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude-it was incredibly original and wonderful."
693003	The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others.
693004	Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband, Joyce Carol Oates wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying."
693005	Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through more immediately palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.
693006	Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him onstage during her own concerts.
693007	Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included The Byrds; Sonny and Cher; The Hollies; Peter, Paul and Mary; The Association; Manfred Mann; and The Turtles.
693008	Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces.
693009	The cover versions became so ubiquitous that CBS started to promote him with the tag "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan."
693010	"Mixed Up Confusion", recorded during the Freewheelin' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn.
693011	In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound.
693012	Cameron Crowe described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records."
694000	In May 1963, Dylan's political profile was raised when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show.
694001	During rehearsals, Dylan had been informed by CBS Television's "head of program practices" that the song he was planning to perform, "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues", was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society.
694002	Rather than comply with the censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the program.
694003	By this time, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.
694004	Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.
694005	The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary, real life stories, with "Only A Pawn In Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.
694006	On a more general theme, "Ballad of Hollis Brown" and "North Country Blues" address the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities.
694007	This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings". By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.
694008	These tensions were publicly displayed when, accepting the "Tom Paine Award" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.
694009	Another Side of Bob Dylan, recorded on a single June evening in 1964, had a lighter mood than its predecessor.
694010	The surreal, humorous Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free No. 10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "Spanish Harlem Incident" and "To Ramona" are romantic and passionate love songs, while "Black Crow Blues" and "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "
694011	It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him.
694012	His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic "Chimes of Freedom", which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by Allen Ginsberg as "chains of flashing images," and "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.
695000	In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan's appearance and musical style changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary songwriter of the folk scene to folk-rock pop-music star.
695001	His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointy "Beatle boots". A London reporter wrote: "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo."
695002	Dylan also began to spar in increasingly surreal ways with his interviewers.
695003	Appearing on the Les Crane TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie.
695004	Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."
695005	Dylan's April 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was yet another stylistic leap, featuring his first recordings made with electric instruments.
695006	The first single, "Subterranean Homesick Blues", owed much to Chuck Berry's "Too Much Monkey Business"; its free association lyrics have been described as both harkening back to the manic energy of Beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.
695007	The song was provided with an early music video which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, Dont Look Back.
695008	Instead of miming to the recording, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground.
695009	Pennebaker has said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been widely imitated in both music videos and advertisements.
695010	The second side of Bringing It All Back Home consisted of four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. "
695011	Mr. Tambourine Man" quickly became one of Dylan's best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in both the U.S. and the UK charts. "
695012	It's All Over Now Baby Blue" and "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" were acclaimed as two of Dylan's most important compositions.
696000	In 1965, as the headliner at the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed his first electric set since his high school days with a pickup group drawn mostly from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, featuring Mike Bloomfield (guitar), Sam Lay (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus Al Kooper (organ) and Barry Goldberg (piano). Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs.
696001	One version of the legend has it that the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar.
696002	Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."
696003	An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set.
696004	This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his audio recording of the concert proves that the only boos were in reaction to the emcee's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.
696005	Nevertheless, Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.
696006	In the September issue of Sing Out!, singer Ewan MacColl wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel."
696007	On July 29, just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording "Positively 4th Street". The lyrics teemed with images of vengeance and paranoia, and it was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community-friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.
697000	In July 1965, Dylan released the single "Like a Rolling Stone", which peaked at number two in the U.S. and at number four in the UK charts.
697001	At over six minutes, the song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey.
697002	Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, "that snare shot sounded like somebody 'dkickedso kicked open the door to your mind". In 2004 and again in 2011, Rolling Stone magazine listed it as number one on its list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". The song also opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, titled after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.
697003	The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. "
697004	Desolation Row", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass, offers the sole exception, with Dylan making surreal allusions to a variety of figures in Western culture during this epic song, described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse."
697005	In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band.
697006	Mike Bloomfield was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew with Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, best known at the time for being part of Ronnie Hawkins's backing band The Hawks (later to become The Band). On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound.
697007	The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.
698000	While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered.
698001	Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men.
698002	At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from New York City to play on the sessions.
698003	The Nashville sessions produced the double-album Blonde on Blonde (1966), featuring what Dylan later called "that thin wild mercury sound". Al Kooper described the album as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.
698004	On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model Sara Lownds.
698005	Some of Dylan's friends (including Ramblin' Jack Elliott) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.
698006	Journalist Nora Ephron first made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed."
698007	Dylan undertook a world tour of Australia and Europe in early 1966.
698008	Each show was split into two parts.
698009	Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.
698010	In the second half, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music.
698011	This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow handclapped.
698012	The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966.
698013	An official recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966.
698014	At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: "Judas!"
698015	to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you ... You're a liar!"
698016	Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"
698017	as they launched into the final song of the night-"Like a Rolling Stone."
699000	During his 1966 tour, Dylan was frequently described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip". D. A. Pennebaker, the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else."
699001	In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, "I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things ... just to keep going, you know?"
699002	In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview which Robert Shelton had taped in 1966, Dylan claimed that he had kicked a heroin habit in New York City: "I got very, very strung out for a while ... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it."
699003	Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career."
699004	After his European tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures on him increased.
699005	ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.
699006	His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula.
699007	Manager Albert Grossman had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall.
699008	On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle on a road near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground.
699009	Though the extent of his injuries were never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.
699010	Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.
699011	Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the much-needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him.
699012	Dylan confirmed this interpretation of the crash when he stated in his autobiography, "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race."
699013	In the wake of his accident, Dylan withdrew from the public and, apart from a few select appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.
700000	Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for Eat the Document, a rarely exhibited follow-up to Dont Look Back.
700001	A rough cut was shown to ABC Television and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.
700002	In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, called "Big Pink". These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for Julie Driscoll ("This Wheel's on Fire"), The Byrds ("You Ain't Goin' Nowhere", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and Manfred Mann ("Mighty Quinn"). Columbia released selections from them in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.
700003	Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various bootleg recordings, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes, containing 107 songs and alternate takes.
700004	In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they first worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves The Band, thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.
700005	In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to Nashville.
700006	Back in the recording studio after a 19-month break, he was accompanied only by Charlie McCoy on bass, Kenny Buttrey on drums, and Pete Drake on steel guitar.
700007	The result was John Wesley Harding, a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the American West and the Bible.
700008	The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.
700009	It included "All Along the Watchtower", with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah (21:5-9). The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix, whose version Dylan later acknowledged as definitive.
700010	Woody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by The Band.
701000	Dylan's next release, Nashville Skyline (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with Johnny Cash, and the hit single "Lay Lady Lay."
701001	Variety magazine wrote, "Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."
701002	Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets, but only their recording of Dylan's "Girl from the North Country" was used on the album.
701003	In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of Johnny Cash's new television show, duetting with Cash on "Girl from the North Country", "I Threw It All Away", and "Living the Blues". Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight rock festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival far closer to his home.
701004	In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality.
701005	Rolling Stone magazine writer Greil Marcus notoriously asked "What is this shit?"
701006	on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970.
701007	In general, Self Portrait, a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received.
701008	In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, which some considered a return to form.
701009	In November 1968, Dylan had co-written "I'd Have You Anytime" with George Harrison; Harrison recorded both "I'd Have You Anytime" and Dylan's "If Not for You" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass.
701010	Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted much media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.
701011	Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's Greenwich Village.
701012	These sessions resulted in one single, "Watching the River Flow", and a new recording of "When I Paint My Masterpiece". On November 4, 1971 Dylan recorded "George Jackson", which he released a week later.
701013	For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin Prison earlier that year.
701014	Dylan contributed piano and harmony vocals to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972.
702000	In 1972, Dylan signed onto Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing the role of "Alias", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.
702001	Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" has proven its durability as one of Dylan's most extensively covered songs.
702002	Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new record label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired.
702003	On his next album, Planet Waves, he used The Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a major tour.
702004	The album included two versions of "Forever Young", which became one of his most popular songs.
702005	As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan", and Dylan himself commented: "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental."
702006	Biographer Howard Sounes noted that Jakob Dylan believed the song was about him.
702007	Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a haphazard collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively cover songs), which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.
702008	In January 1974, Dylan returned to live touring after a break of seven years; backed by The Band, he embarked on a high-profile, coast-to-coast North American tour, playing 40 concerts.
702009	A live double album of the tour, Before the Flood, was released on Asylum Records.
702010	Soon, Columbia Records sent word that they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, apparently miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had managed to sell only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves.
702011	Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which subsequently reissued his two Asylum albums on their imprint.
703000	After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged.
703001	He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and quickly recorded a new album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974.
703002	Dylan delayed the album's release, and re-recorded half of the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother David Zimmerman.
703003	Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews.
703004	In the NME, Nick Kent described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes."
703005	In Rolling Stone, reviewer Jon Landau wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness."
703006	Over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his mid-1960s trilogy of albums.
703007	In Salon.com, Bill Wyman wrote: "Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."
703008	Novelist Rick Moody called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape."
703009	That summer Dylan wrote a lengthy ballad championing the cause of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who had been imprisoned for a triple murder committed in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966.
703010	After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "Hurricane", presenting the case for Carter's innocence.
703011	Despite its 8:32 minute length, the song was released as a single, peaking at No.33 on the U.S. Billboard Chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue, named after the Shoshone medicine man, shaman, teacher, and activist Rolling Thunder.
703012	The tour was a varied evening of entertainment featuring about one hundred performers and supporters drawn from the resurgent Greenwich Village folk scene, including T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Joni Mitchell, David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Joan Baez, and violinist Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered while she was walking down the street, her violin case hanging on her back.
703013	Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was simultaneously shooting.
703014	Sam Shepard was initially hired to write the film's screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.
704000	Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire, with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost travelogue-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright Jacques Levy.
704001	The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, Hard Rain, and the LP Hard Rain; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's Live 1975.
704002	The 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling and improvised narrative, mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.
704003	Released in 1978, the movie received generally poor, sometimes scathing, reviews and had a very brief theatrical run.
704004	Later in that year, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, to be more widely released.
704005	In November 1976, Dylan appeared at The Band's "farewell" concert, along with other guests including Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison and Neil Young.
704006	Martin Scorsese's acclaimed cinematic chronicle of this show, The Last Waltz, was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan's set.
704007	In 1976, Dylan also wrote and duetted on the song "Sign Language" for Eric Clapton's No Reason To Cry.
704008	In 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million people.
704009	For the tour, Dylan assembled an eight piece band, and was also accompanied by three backing singers.
704010	Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were recorded and released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan.
704011	Reviews were mixed.
704012	Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: "These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals."
704013	When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978, he was dismayed the press described the look and sound of the show as a 'Las Vegas Tour'. The 1978 tour grossed more than $20 million, and Dylan acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times that he had some debts to pay off because "I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California."
705000	In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same large band and backing vocalists into Rundown Studios, a rehearsal space Dylan had rented in Santa Monica, California, to record an album of new material: Street-Legal.
705001	It was described by Michael Gray as, "after Blood On The Tracks, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life". However, it suffered from poor sound recording and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.
705002	In the late 1970s, Dylan became a born-again Christian and released two albums of Christian gospel music.
705003	Slow Train Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R&B producer, Jerry Wexler.
705004	Wexler recalled that when Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording, he replied: "Bob, you're dealing with a sixty-two-year old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album."
705005	The album won Dylan a Grammy Award as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "Gotta Serve Somebody". The second evangelical album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, and was described by Dylan critic Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior."
705006	When touring in late 1979 and early 1980 Dylan, would not play any of his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as: Years ago they ... said I was a prophet.
705007	I used to say, "No I'm not a prophet" they say "Yes you are a prophet, you're."
705008	I said, "No it's not me."
705009	They used to say "You sure are a prophet."
705010	They used to convince me I was a prophet.
705011	Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer.
705012	They say, "Bob Dylan's no prophet."
705013	They just can't handle it.
706000	Dylan's embrace of born-again Christianity was unpopular with some of his fans and fellow musicians.
706001	Shortly before his murder, John Lennon recorded "Serve Yourself" in response to Dylan's "Gotta Serve Somebody". By 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in the New York Times that "neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament."
706002	In late 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring for a series of concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", where he restored several of his popular 1960s songs to the repertoire.
706003	Shot of Love, recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs.
706004	The song "Every Grain of Sand" reminded some critics of William Blake's verses.
706005	In the 1980s the reception of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded Infidels in 1983 to the panned Down in the Groove in 1988.
706006	Critics such as Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.
706007	As an example of the latter, the Infidels recording sessions, which again employed Mark Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs which Dylan left off the album.
706008	Most well regarded of these were "Blind Willie McTell", a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history, "Foot of Pride" and "Lord Protect My Child". These three songs were later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991.
706009	Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque.
706010	Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, was asked to engineer and mix the album.
706011	Baker has said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".
707000	Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief fundraising single "We Are the World". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia.
707001	Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, Dylan performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."
707002	His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.
707003	In April 1986, Dylan made a brief foray into the world of rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock", a song featured on Kurtis Blow's album Kingdom Blow.
707004	Dylan's next studio album, Knocked Out Loaded, was released in July 1986 and contained three cover songs (by Little Junior Parker, Kris Kristofferson and the traditional gospel hymn "Precious Memories"), plus three collaborations with other writers (Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager), and two solo compositions by Dylan.
707005	One reviewer commented that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."
707006	It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.
707007	Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, 'Brownsville Girl', a work of genius.
708000	In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night.
708001	Dylan also toured with The Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in a live album Dylan & The Dead.
708002	This album received some very negative reviews: Allmusic said, "Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead."
708003	After performing with these musical permutations, Dylan initiated what came to be called The Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a tight back-up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith.
708004	Dylan would continue to tour with a small, constantly evolving band for the next 20 years.
708005	In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (played by Rupert Everett). Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack-"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.
708006	Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introductory speech declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.
708007	When Dylan released the album Down in the Groove in May 1988, it was even more unsuccessful in its sales than his previous studio album.
708008	Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."
708009	The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys.
708010	Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached number three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.
708011	Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.
709000	Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.
709001	Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."
709002	The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.
709003	The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.
709004	Dylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy.
709005	The album contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo"; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four at that time.
709006	Sidemen on the album included George Harrison, Slash from Guns N' Roses, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John.
709007	Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.
709008	In 1991, Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson.
709009	The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed his song "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech that startled some of the audience.
709010	The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: Good as I Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work.
709011	Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim", penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence.
709012	In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged.
709013	He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.
709014	The album produced from it, MTV Unplugged, included "John Brown", an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and jingoism.
710000	With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997.
710001	The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.
710002	Late that spring, before the album's release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis.
710003	His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon."
710004	He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy.
710005	The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric "Blowin' in the Wind". September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, Time Out of Mind.
710006	With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed.
710007	One critic wrote: "the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years."
710008	This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" Grammy Award.
710009	In December 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House, paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."
710010	Dylan commenced the new millennium by winning the Polar Music Prize in May 2000 and his first Oscar; his song "Things Have Changed", penned for the film Wonder Boys, won an Academy Award in March 2001.
710011	The Oscar, by some reports a facsimile, tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier.
711000	"Love and Theft" was released on September 11, 2001.
711001	Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album himself under the pseudonym Jack Frost.
711002	The album was critically well received and earned nominations for several Grammy awards.
711003	Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz, and even lounge ballads. "
711004	Love and Theft" generated controversy when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Japanese author Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza.
711005	In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his "born again" period and participated in the CD project Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan.
711006	That year also saw the release of the film Masked & Anonymous, which Dylan co-wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov.
711007	Dylan played the central character in the film, Jack Fate, alongside a cast which included Jeff Bridges, Penélope Cruz and John Goodman.
711008	The film polarised critics: many dismissed it as an "incoherent mess"; a few treated it as a serious work of art.
711009	In October 2004, Dylan published the first part of his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One.
711010	The book confounded expectations.
711011	Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961-1962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height.
711012	He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award.
711013	No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film biography of Dylan, was first broadcast on September 26-27, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and PBS in the US.
711014	The documentary focuses on the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples, and Dylan himself.
711015	The film received a Peabody Award in April 2006 and a Columbia-duPont Award in January 2007.
711016	The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early career.
712000	Dylan earned yet another distinction in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by The Beatles, who were second.
712001	Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives.
712002	The most widely cited lines included "you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows" from "Subterranean Homesick Blues" and "when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose" from "Like a Rolling Stone". May 3, 2006, was the premiere of Dylan's radio presenting career, hosting a weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour, for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around a chosen theme.
712003	Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and The Streets.
712004	The show was praised by fans and critics as "great radio," as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices.
712005	In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was "Goodbye" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's "So Long, It's Been Good To Know Yuh". This has led to speculation that Dylan's radio series may have ended.
712006	On August 29, 2006, Dylan released his Modern Times album.
712007	Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as "a catarrhal death rattle") most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and "Love and Theft". Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.
712008	The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.
725000	In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with.
725001	While shooting Gia, she told her then-husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"
725002	After Gia wrapped in 1997, Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."
725003	She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes; she later described it as "just good for me to collect myself."
725004	Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, she resumed her career.
725005	Jolie returned to film in the 1998 gangster movie Hell's Kitchen.
725006	Later that year, she appeared in Playing by Heart, part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillippe, and Jon Stewart.
725007	The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular.
725008	The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."
725009	Jolie won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
725010	In 1999, she starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett.
725011	The film received a mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's characterâ   Thornton's seductive wifeâ   was particularly criticized.
725012	The Washington Post wrote, "Mary (Angelina Jolie) [is] a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."
725013	She then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), an adaptation of a crime novel by Jeffery Deaver.
725014	Jolie played a police officer haunted by her cop father's suicide, who reluctantly helps Washington track down a serial killer.
725015	The movie grossed $151 million worldwide, but was a critical failure.
725016	The Detroit Free Press concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."
726000	Jolie next took the supporting role of the sociopathic mental patient Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of author Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name.
726001	While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.
726002	She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
726003	Variety noted, "Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."
726004	In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone In 60 Seconds, in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, the ex-girlfriend of car thief Nicolas Cage.
726005	The role was small, and The Washington Post criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."
726006	She later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after the emotionally heavy role of Lisa Rowe.
726007	It became her highest-grossing movie to that point, earning $237 million internationally.
726008	Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar.
726009	An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogame, Jolie was required to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the title role of Lara Croft.
726010	She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews.
726011	Slant commented, "Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but [director] Simon West makes her journey into a game of Frogger."
726012	The movie was an international success nonetheless, earning $275 million worldwide, and launched her global reputation as a female action star.
727000	Jolie then starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), a thriller based on the novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich.
727001	The film was a major critical failure, with The New York Times noting, "The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."
727002	In 2002, she starred in Life or Something Like It as an ambitious television reporter who is told that she will die in a week.
727003	The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews.
727004	CNN's Paul Clinton wrote, "Jolie is excellent in her role. Despite some of the ludicrous plot points in the middle of the film, this Academy Award-winning actress is exceedingly believable in her journey towards self-discovery and the true meaning of fulfilling life."
727005	Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which established her among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses.
727006	The sequel was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156 million at the international box office.
727007	She appeared in the music video for Korn's "Did My Time", which was used to promote the film.
727008	She next starred in Beyond Borders (2003), as a socialite who joins aid workers in Africa and Asia.
727009	The film reflected Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, but it was critically and financially unsuccessful.
727010	The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in Girl, Interrupted, can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand.
727011	She can also, witness the Lara Croft films, do acknowledged cartoons. But the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."
727012	In 2004, Jolie starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the thriller Taking Lives.
727013	She portrayed an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer.
727014	The movie received mixed reviews and The Hollywood Reporter concluded, "Angelina Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."
727015	She also provided the voice of the angelfish Lola in the DreamWorks animated movie Shark Tale (2004), and had a brief appearance in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), a science fiction adventure film shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen.
727016	That same year, Jolie played Olympias in Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great.
727017	The film failed domestically, which director Oliver Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with revenue of $139 million outside the United States.
728000	Jolie then starred opposite Brad Pitt in the 2005 action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which tells the story of a bored married couple, John and Jane Smith, who find out that they are both secret assassins.
728001	The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads.
728002	The Star Tribune noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."
728003	The movie earned $478 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest grossing film of 2005.
728004	Jolie next appeared in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), a film about the early history of the CIA, as seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson, an officer based on James Jesus Angleton and played by Matt Damon.
728005	Jolie played the supporting role of Margaret "Clover" Russell, Wilson's neglected wife.
728006	According to the Chicago Tribune, "Jolie ages convincingly throughout, and is blithely unconcerned with how her brittle character is coming off in terms of audience sympathy."
728007	In 2007, Jolie made her directorial debut with the documentary A Place in Time, which captures daily life in 27 locations around the world during a single week.
728008	The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and was intended for distribution to high schools through the National Education Association.
728009	Jolie then starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan.
728010	The Hollywood Reporter described Jolie's performance as "well-measured and moving," played "with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent."
728011	Jolie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance.
728012	She also played Grendel's mother in the animated epic Beowulf (2007), which was created through the motion capture technique.
729000	Jolie co-starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the 2008 action movie Wanted, an adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name.
729001	The film received predominately favorable reviews and proved an international success, earning $342 million worldwide.
729002	She also provided the voice of Master Tigress in the DreamWorks animated movie Kung Fu Panda (2008). With revenue of $632 million internationally, it became the third-highest grossing film of 2008.
729003	That same year, Jolie took on the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling.
729004	Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film stars Jolie as Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angelesâ   only to realize the boy is an impostor.
729005	The Chicago Tribune noted, "Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes [...] when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril."
729006	Jolie received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award.
729007	Jolie next starred in the 2010 thriller Salt, her first film in two years.
729008	She starred alongside Liev Schreiber as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent.
729009	Originally written as a male character, Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role to director Phillip Noyce.
729010	The film was an international success with revenues of $294 million.
729011	It received mixed to positive reviews, with Jolie's performance earning praise; Empire remarked, "When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business."
729012	She also starred opposite Johnny Depp in The Tourist (2010), which was a major critical failure.
729013	Peter Travers wrote, "Depp and Jolie hit career lows, producing the chemistry of high-fashion zombies."
729014	Roger Ebert defended Jolie, stating she "does her darndest" and "plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality."
729015	Despite the general criticism, after a slow start at the domestic box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278 million worldwide.
729016	Jolie received a controversial Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.
730000	In 2011, Jolie reprised her voice role as Master Tigress in the animated DreamWorks sequel Kung Fu Panda 2.
730001	It became the fourth-highest grossing film of 2011 and Jolie's highest grossing film to date, earning $666 million at the international box office.
730002	She also made her directorial feature debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner of war, set during the 1992â   95 Bosnian War.
730003	Jolie, who had twice visited Bosnia-Herzegovina in her capacity as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, explained that she made the film to rekindle attention for the survivors of a war that took place in recent history.
730004	The film, which Jolie also scripted and co-produced, aroused both praise and criticism in the Balkans; the response from Bosniak war-victims advocacy organizations was "overwhelmingly positive," while a Serb war prisoners group decried the film for its alleged anti-Serb bias.
730005	Sarajevo's regional government named Jolie an honorary citizen of the capital for raising awareness of the war.
730006	In the Land of Blood and Honey won the Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America, which honors films that highlight provocative social issues.
730007	It also received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
730008	Jolie will play the Disney villain Maleficent in the upcoming film of the same name, where the character's background story will be revealed.
730009	In February 2013, it was announced that Jolie will be teaming up with the Coen brothers to tell the story of World War II hero Louis Zamperini.
730010	The brothers are set to rewrite Unbroken, the adaptation of the 2010 book by Laura Hillenbrand.
730011	Jolie is set to direct the film.
806000	Paul and Linda were vegetarians for most of their 30-year marriage.
806001	They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb.
806002	Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists.
806003	In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients.
806004	In 1995, he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth, written by Tony Wardle.
806005	McCartney is a supporter of the animal-rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
806006	He has appeared in the group's campaigns and, in 2009, he narrated a short factory farm exposé titled "Glass Walls."
806007	McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, the World Society for the Protection of Animals, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation.
806008	Following McCartney's marriage to Mills, he joined her in a campaign against landmines, becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield.
806009	He wore an anti-landmines T-shirt during some of the Back in the World tour shows.
806010	In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting.
806011	The couple debated with Danny Williams, Newfoundland's then Premier, on Larry King Live, stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead.
806012	McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign.
806013	McCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances, including the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Live Aid and the recording of "Ferry Cross the Mersey". In 2004, he donated a song to an album to aid the "US Campaign for Burma", in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
806014	In 2008, he donated a song to Aid Still Required's CD, organised as an effort to raise funds to assist with the recovery from the devastation caused in Southeast Asia by the 2004 tsunami.
807000	In 2009, McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking him why he was not a vegetarian.
807001	As McCartney explained, "He wrote back very kindly, saying, my doctors tell me that I must eat meat. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right   the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'"
807002	On the eve of the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, McCartney issued a video endorsement of President Barack Obama.
807003	In August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton, and later went to Bangor in North Wales, to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation.
807004	He explained, "The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing". In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising three million dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.
807005	McCartney has publicly professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool.
807006	In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, "Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'"
808000	McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959.
808001	According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations.
808002	He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like Brigitte Bardot's, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect.
808003	When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962.
808004	The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now "free of obligation", ended the engagement.
808005	McCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
808006	The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.
808007	They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in St. John's Wood, in March 1966.
808008	He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including "Yesterday", "And I Love Her", "You Won't See Me" and "I'm Looking Through You", the latter three having been inspired by their romance.
808009	They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with Francie Schwartz.
808010	Linda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio."
808011	At times, she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry.
808012	She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966.
808013	She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked."
808014	The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.
808015	As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!"
808016	Linda said this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up."
808017	The pair married in 1969.
808018	About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment."
808019	He added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did."
1018000	Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer-songwriter, dancer, businessman and philanthropist.
1018001	Often referred to by the honorific nickname "King of Pop", or by his initials MJ, Jackson is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records.
1018002	His contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.
1018003	The eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.
1018004	In the early 1980s, Jackson became the dominant figure in popular music.
1018005	The music videos for his songs, including those of "Beat It," "Billie Jean," and "Thriller," were credited with breaking down racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool.
1018006	The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then relatively new television channel MTV to fame.
1018007	With videos such as "Black or White" and "Scream" he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist.
1018008	Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot, and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name.
1018009	His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous hip hop, post-disco, contemporary R&B, pop, and rock artists.
1018010	Jackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time.
1018011	His other records, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling.
1018012	Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.
1018013	He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music.
1018014	Some of his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records; 13 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 26 American Music Awards, more than any other artist, including the "Artist of the Century" and "Artist of the 1980s"; 13 number-one singles in the United States in his solo career, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era; and the estimated sale of over 400 million records worldwide.[
1018015	Note 1] Jackson has won hundreds of awards, making him the most-awarded recording artist in the history of popular music.
1018016	In what would have been Jackson's 52nd birthday on August 29, 2010, he became the most downloaded artist of all time.
1018017	Jackson constantly traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism and the 2000 Guinness Book of Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities.
1019000	Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy.
1019001	In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the case was settled out of court for about $25 million and no formal charges were brought.
1019002	In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts.
1019003	While preparing for his comeback concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.
1019004	The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
1019005	Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world.
1019006	Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana.
1019007	He was the eighth of ten children in an African-American working-class family who lived in a 3-room house in Gary, an industrial city near Chicago.
1019008	His mother, Katherine Esther Scruse, was a devout Jehovah's Witness, and his father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, was a steel mill worker who performed with an R&B band called The Falcons.
1019009	Jackson had three sisters: Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet, and five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy.
1019010	A sixth brother, Brandon, who was a twin of older brother Marlon, died shortly after birth.
1019011	Jackson had a troubled relationship with his father, Joe.
1019012	Joseph acknowledged in 2003 that he regularly whipped Jackson as a boy.
1019013	Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals, though he also credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success.
1019014	Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, broadcast in February 1993.
1019015	He admitted that he had often cried from loneliness and he would vomit on the sight of his father.
1019016	Jackson's father was also said to have verbally abused Jackson, saying that he had a fat nose on numerous occasions.
1019017	In fact, Michael Jackson's deep dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain hyper-compliant especially with his father, and to remain childlike throughout his adult life are in many ways consistent with the effects of this chronic maltreatment he endured as a young child.
1020000	In an interview with Martin Bashir, later included in the 2003 broadcast of Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson acknowledged that his father hurt him when he was a child, but was nonetheless a "genius", as he admitted his father's strict discipline played a huge role in his success.
1020001	When Bashir dismissed the positive remark and continued asking about beatings, Jackson put his hand over his face and objected to the questions.
1020002	He recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you". In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers - a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine - as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.
1020003	Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing.
1020004	When he was eight, Jackson began sharing the lead vocals with his older brother Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to The Jackson 5.
1020005	The band toured the Midwest extensively from 1966 to 1968, frequently performing at a string of black clubs known as the "chitlin' circuit", where they often opened stripteases and other adult acts.
1020006	In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of Motown hits and James Brown's "I Got You (I Feel Good)", led by Michael.
1020007	The Jackson 5 recorded several songs, including "Big Boy", for the local record label Steeltown in 1967, before signing with Motown Records in 1968.
1020008	Rolling Stone magazine later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts," writing that he "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer."
1020009	The group set a chart record when its first four singles ("I Want You Back", "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be There") peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.
1020010	Between 1972 and 1975, Michael released four solo studio albums with Motown, among them Got to Be There and Ben, released as part of the Jackson 5 franchise, and producing successful singles such as "Got to Be There", "Ben", and a remake of Bobby Day's "Rockin' Robin".
1021000	The Jackson 5 "became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists... five working-class black boys with afros and bell bottoms, and they really didn't have to trade any of that stuff in order to become mainstream stars."
1021001	The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input.
1021002	Although they scored several top 40 hits, including the top 5 disco single "Dancing Machine" and the top 20 hit "I Am Love", the Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975.
1021003	In June 1975, the Jackson 5 signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records and renamed themselves the Jacksons.
1021004	Younger brother Randy formally joined the band around this time, while Jermaine chose to stay with Motown and pursue a solo career.
1021005	They continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984, during which Michael was the lead songwriter, writing hits such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", "This Place Hotel", and "Can You Feel It". In 1978, he starred as the Scarecrow in the musical, The Wiz, a box-office disaster.
1021006	It was here that he teamed up with Quincy Jones, who was arranging the film's musical score.
1021007	Jones agreed to produce Jackson's next solo album, Off the Wall.
1021008	In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine.
1021009	His subsequent rhinoplasty was not a complete success; he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career.
1021010	He was referred to Dr. Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and subsequent operations.
1021011	Jones and Jackson produced the Off the Wall album together.
1021012	Songwriters for the album included Jackson, Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder, and Paul McCartney.
1021013	Released in 1979, it was the first solo album to generate four U.S. top 10 hits, including the chart-topping singles "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You". It reached number three on the Billboard 200 and eventually sold over 20 million copies worldwide.
1021014	In 1980, Jackson won three awards at the American Music Awards for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". That year, he also won Billboard Year-End for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, also for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". Jackson again won at the American Music Awards in 1981 for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.
1021015	Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a much bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.
1021016	In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.
1022000	In 1982, Jackson contributed the song "Someone In the Dark" to the storybook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial; the record won a Grammy for Best Recording for Children in 1984.
1022001	In the same year he won another seven Grammys and eight American Music Awards (including the Award of Merit, the youngest artist to win it), making him the most awarded artist in one night for both award shows.
1022002	These awards were thanks to the Thriller album, released in late 1982, which was 1983's best-selling album worldwide and became the best-selling album of all time in the United States, as well as the best-selling album of all time worldwide, selling an estimated 65 million copies.
1022003	The album topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks.
1022004	It was the first album to have seven Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including "Billie Jean", "Beat It", and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". Thriller was certified for 29 million shipments by the RIAA, giving it Double Diamond status in the United States.
1022005	The album won also another Grammy for Best Engineered Recording - Non Classical in 1984, awarding Bruce Swedien for his work.
1022006	Jackson's attorney John Branca noted that Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point: approximately $2 for every album sold.
1022007	He was also making record-breaking profits from sales of his recordings.
1022008	The videocassette of the documentary The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller sold over 350,000 copies in a few months.
1022009	The era saw the arrival of novelties like dolls modeled after Michael Jackson, which appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.
1022010	Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli writes that, "Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item-like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie-and started selling like a household staple."
1022011	In 1985, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Longform.
1022012	In December 2009, the music video for "Thriller" was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, "Thriller" is the first (and currently only) music video ever to be inducted.
1023000	Time described Jackson's influence at that point as "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too". The New York Times wrote that, "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else". On March 25, 1983, Michael Jackson reunited with his brothers for a legendary live performance which was taped for a Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever television special.
1023001	The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an audience of 47 million viewers, and featured the Jacksons and a number of other Motown stars.
1023002	It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of "Billie Jean" which gave him his first Emmy nomination.
1023003	Wearing a distinctive black sequin jacket and golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years before.
1023004	The performance almost did not happen with Jackson originally turning down the invitation to perform, however at Berry Gordy's request, Jackson agreed to do the show.
1023005	Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and The Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.
1023006	Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times later wrote, "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing."
1023007	Berry Gordy said of the performance, "from the first beat of Billie Jean, I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down."
1024000	On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi Cola commercial, overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, from ad agency BBDO and Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, Alan Pottasch at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
1024001	In front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire.
1024002	He suffered second-degree burns to his scalp.
1024003	Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars on his scalp, and he also had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Jackson never recovered from this injury.
1024004	Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated his $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California, which now has a "Michael Jackson Burn Center" in honor of his donation.
1024005	Dusenberry later recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising.
1024006	On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award from President Ronald Reagan for his support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.
1024007	Jackson won eight awards during the Grammys that year.
1024008	Unlike later albums, Thriller did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 Victory Tour, headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans.
1024009	He donated all the funds (around $8 million) raised from the Victory Tour to charity.
1024010	He also co-wrote the charity single "We Are the World" in 1985 with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in the U.S. and Africa.
1024011	It became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 30 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief.
1024012	In 1986, "We Are the World" won four Grammys (one for Jackson for Song of the Year). American Music Award directors removed the charity song from the competition because they felt it would be inappropriate, but recognized it with two special honors: one for the creation of the song and one for the USA for Africa idea.
1024013	Michael won the award for the creation of the song.
1025000	In 1984, ATV Music Publishing, which had the copyrights to nearly 4000 songs, including the Northern Songs catalog that contained the majority of the Lennon-McCartney compositions recorded by The Beatles, was put up for sale by Robert Holmes à Court.
1025001	Jackson had become interested in owning music catalogs after working with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s.
1025002	Jackson had learned McCartney made approximately $40 million a year from other people's songs.
1025003	In 1981, McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million). According to McCartney, he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost equally at £10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for £5 million each. When they were unable to make the joint purchase, McCartney let the offer fall through, not wanting to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs.
1025004	According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, "We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time."
1025005	Also, an attorney for McCartney assured Jackson's attorney, John Branca, that McCartney was not interested in bidding: McCartney reportedly said "It's too pricey". But there were several other companies and investors bidding.
1025006	In September 1984, Jackson was first informed about the sale by Branca and sent a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984.
1025007	Jackson's agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate.
1025008	In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from talks after having spent over $1 million on four months of due diligence and on the negotiations.
1025009	In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Co. had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million.
1025010	But in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed.
1025011	Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million and it was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music.
1025012	He also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.
1025013	Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized August 10, 1985.
1026000	Jackson's skin had been a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the mid-1980s, it gradually grew paler.
1026001	The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that he might be bleaching his skin.
1026002	According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, in 1986, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo and lupus; the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission; both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight.
1026003	The treatments he used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he could appear very pale.
1026004	Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy.
1026005	By the mid-1990s several surgeons speculated that he had undergone various nasal surgeries, a forehead lift, thinned lips, and cheekbone surgery-although Jackson denied this and insisted that he only had surgery on his nose.
1026006	Jackson claimed that he had only two rhinoplasties and no other surgery on his face, although at one point he mentioned having a dimple created in his chin.
1026007	Jackson lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a dancer's body". Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from anorexia nervosa; periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life.
1026008	During the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, and Klein's nurse Debbie Rowe.
1026009	Rowe eventually became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two eldest children.
1026010	He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and business advice.
1026011	Jackson became the subject of increasingly sensational reports.
1026012	In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box.
1026013	Although the claim was untrue, according to tabloid reports that are widely cited, Jackson had disseminated the fabricated story himself.
1026014	When Jackson bought a chimpanzee called Bubbles from a laboratory, he was reported to be increasingly detached from reality.
1026015	It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the "elephant man") and although untrue, Jackson did not deny the story.
1026016	Although initially he saw these stories as opportunities for publicity, he stopped leaking untruths to the press as they became more sensational.
1026017	Consequently the media began making up their own stories.
1026018	These reports became embedded in the public consciousness, inspiring the nickname "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson came to despise.
1026019	Responding to the gossip, Jackson remarked to Taraborrelli:
1027000	Why not just tell people I'm an alien from Mars? Tell them I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight. They'll believe anything you say, because you're a reporter. But if I, Michael Jackson, were to say, "I'm an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight," people would say, "Oh, man, that Michael Jackson is nuts. He's cracked up. You can't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth."
1027001	Jackson collaborated with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 3-D film Captain EO, which debuted in September 1986 at both the original Disneyland and at EPCOT in Florida, and in March 1987 at Tokyo Disneyland.
1027002	The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks.
1027003	A Captain EO attraction was later featured at Euro Disneyland after that park opened in 1992.
1027004	All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation was the last one to close, in 1998.
1027005	The attraction would later return to Disneyland in 2010 after Jackson's death.
1027006	In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses, in response to their disapproval of the Thriller video.
1027007	With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated.
1027008	It did not top Thriller as a commercial or artistic triumph, but Bad was still a substantial success in its own right.
1027009	The Bad album spawned seven hit singles in the U.S., five of which ("I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror" and "Dirty Diana") reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.
1027010	This was a record for most number one Hot 100 singles from any one album, including Thriller.
1027011	Although the title track's video was arguably derivative of the video for the earlier single "Beat It", the "Bad" video still proved to be one of Jackson's iconic moments.
1027012	It was a gritty but colorful epic set against the backdrop of the New York City Subway system, with costuming and choreography inspired by West Side Story.
1027013	As of 2012, the album sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide.
1027014	Thanks to the Bad album, Bruce Swedien and Humberto Gatica won one Grammy in 1988 for Best Engineered Recording - Non Classical and Michael Jackson won one Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form for "Leave Me Alone" in 1989.
1027015	In the same year, Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music Awards because Bad is the first album ever to generate five number one singles in the U.S., the first album to top in 25 countries and the best-selling album worldwide in 1987 and in 1988.
1027016	In 1988, "Bad" won an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Single.
1028000	The Bad world tour began on September 12 that year, finishing on January 14, 1989.
1028001	In Japan alone, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record of 200,000 in a single tour.
1028002	Jackson broke a Guinness World Record when 504,000 people attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium.
1028003	He performed a total of 123 concerts to an audience of 4.4 million people.
1028004	The Bad Tour turned out to be the last of Jackson's concert tours to include shows in the continental United States, although later tours did make it to Hawaii.
1028005	In 1988, Jackson released his only autobiography, Moonwalk, which took four years to complete and sold 200,000 copies.
1028006	Jackson wrote about his childhood, The Jackson 5, and the abuse he had suffered.
1028007	He also wrote about his facial appearance, saying he had had two rhinoplastic surgeries and a dimple created in his chin.
1028008	He attributed much of the change in the structure of his face to puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hair style, and stage lighting.
1028009	Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list.
1028010	The musician then released a film called Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films that starred Jackson and Joe Pesci.
1028011	The film was originally intended to be released to theaters, but due to financial issues, the film was released direct-to-video.
1028012	It saw a theatrical release in Germany, though. It debuted atop the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks.
1028013	It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues.
1028014	In March 1988, Jackson purchased land near Santa Ynez, California, to build Neverland Ranch at a cost of $17 million.
1028015	He installed Ferris wheels, a menagerie, and a movie theater on the 2,700-acre (11 km2) property.
1028016	A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds.
1028017	In 2003, it was valued at approximately $100 million.
1028018	In 1989, his annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts was estimated at $125 million for that year alone.
1028019	Shortly afterwards, he became the first Westerner to appear in a television ad in the Soviet Union.
942000	Gwen Renée Stefani (/stəˈfɑːni/; born October 3, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, fashion designer and occasional actress.
942001	Stefani is the co-founder and lead vocalist for the rock and ska band No Doubt.
942002	Stefani recorded Love. Angel. Music. Baby., her first solo album, in 2004.
942003	Inspired by music of the 1980s, the album was a success with sales of over seven million copies.
942004	The album's third single, "Hollaback Girl", was the first US digital download to sell one million copies.
942005	Stefani's second and final solo studio album, The Sweet Escape (2006), yielded "Wind It Up", "4 in the Morning", and the highest-selling single "The Sweet Escape". Including her work with No Doubt, Stefani has sold more than forty million albums worldwide.
942006	She won the World's Best-Selling New Female Artist at the World Music Awards 2005.
942007	In 2003, she debuted her clothing line L.A.M.B.
942008	and expanded her collection with the 2005 Harajuku Lovers line, drawing inspiration from Japanese culture and fashion.
942009	Stefani performs and makes public appearances with four back-up dancers known as the Harajuku Girls dancers.
942010	She married British musician Gavin Rossdale in 2002 and they have two sons: Kingston James McGregor Rossdale, born May 26, 2006, and Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale, born August 21, 2008.
942011	Billboard magazine ranked Stefani the fifty-fourth most successful artist and thirty-seventh most successful Hot 100 artist of the 2000-09 decade.
942012	Stefani was born and raised in Fullerton, California, and grew up in a Roman Catholic household.
942013	She attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California.
942014	She was named after a stewardess in the 1968 novel Airport, and her middle name, Renée, comes from The Four Tops' 1968 cover of The Left Banke's 1966 hit song "Walk Away Renée". Her father, Dennis Stefani, is Italian American and worked as a Yamaha marketing executive.
942015	Her mother, Patti (née Flynn), is of Irish and Scottish descent and worked as an accountant before becoming a homemaker.
942016	Gwen's parents were fans of folk music and exposed her to music by artists like Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris.
942017	She is the second oldest of four children: she has a younger sister, Jill Stefani, a younger brother, Todd, and an older brother, Eric.
942018	Eric was the keyboardist for No Doubt; he left the band to pursue a career in animation on The Simpsons on the Fox TV network.
943000	Many of the women in Stefani's family were seamstresses, and much of her clothing was made by them or her mother.
943001	In school, she was diagnosed with dyslexia.
943002	As a child, Stefani's musical interests consisted of musicals such as The Sound of Music and Evita.
943003	After making a demo tape for her father, she was encouraged to take music lessons to train her "loopy, unpredictable" voice.
943004	Stefani made her onstage debut during a talent show at Loara High School, where she sang "I Have Confidence", from The Sound of Music, in a self-made tweed dress inspired by one from the film.
943005	Stefani was on the Loara swim team in an attempt to lose weight.
943006	She first worked at a Dairy Queen and later manned the MAC makeup counter of a department store.
943007	After graduating from high school in 1987, she began attending Fullerton College before transferring to California State University, Fullerton.
943008	Eric introduced Gwen to 2 Tone music by Madness and The Selecter, and in 1986 he invited her to provide vocals for No Doubt, a ska band he was forming.
943009	Finally, in 1991, the band was signed to Interscope Records.
943010	The band released its self-titled debut album in 1992, but its ska-pop sound was unsuccessful due to the popularity of grunge.
943011	Before the mainstream success of both No Doubt and Sublime, Stefani contributed guest vocals to "Saw Red" on Sublime's 1994 album Robbin' the Hood.
943012	Stefani rejected the aggressiveness of female grunge artists and cited Blondie singer Debbie Harry's combination of power and sex appeal as a major influence.
943013	No Doubt's third album, Tragic Kingdom (1995), which followed the self-released The Beacon Street Collection (1995), took more than three years to make.
943014	Five singles were released from Tragic Kingdom'; one of them, "Don't Speak", led the US Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1996.
943015	Stefani left college for one semester to tour for Tragic Kingdom but did not return when touring lasted two and a half years.
943016	The album sold more than sixteen million copies worldwide, and received several Grammy Award nominations.
944000	During the time when No Doubt was receiving mainstream success, Stefani collaborated on the singles "You're the Boss" with The Brian Setzer Orchestra, "South Side" with Moby, and "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" with Eve.
944001	No Doubt released the less popular Return of Saturn in 2000, which expands upon the New Wave influences of Tragic Kingdom.
944002	Most of the lyrical content focuses on Stefani's often rocky relationship with then-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and her overall insecurities, including indecision on settling down and having a child.
944003	The band's 2001 album, Rock Steady, explored more reggae and dancehall sounds, while maintaining the band's New Wave influences, and generally received positive reviews.
944004	The album generated career-highest singles chart positions in the United States, and "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All" received Grammy Awards.
944005	A greatest hits collection, The Singles 1992-2003, which includes a cover of Talk Talk's "It's My Life", was released in 2003 to moderate sales.
944006	In 2002, Eve and Stefani won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Let Me Blow Ya Mind". Following No Doubt's hiatus, Stefani sought out her bandmate Tony Kanal to discuss the possibility of a solo career.
944007	The idea was to make a quick dance record, but this became a large collaboration with other artists, producers and various non-ska influences.
944008	Stefani's debut solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was released in November 2004.
944009	The album features a large number of collaborations with producers and other artists, including Tony Kanal, Linda Perry, André 3000, Nellee Hooper, The Neptunes and New Order.
944010	Stefani created the album to modernize the music to which she listened when in high school, and L.A.M.B. takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as New Wave and electro.
944011	Stefani's decision to use her solo career as an opportunity to delve further into pop music instead of trying "to convince the world of [her] talent, depth and artistic worth" was considered unusual.
944012	As a result, reviews of the album were mixed, and it was described as "fun as hell but [...] not exactly rife with subversive social commentary."
944013	The album debuted on the US Billboard 200 albums chart at number seven, selling 309,000 copies in its first week.
944014	It sold well, reaching multi-platinum status in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.
944015	At the 2005 Grammy Awards, Stefani was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "What You Waiting For?",
944016	and at the next year's awards, Stefani received five nominations for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.
945000	The first single released from the album was "What You Waiting For?", which charted outside the US top forty, but reached the top ten on most other charts.
945001	The song served to explain why Stefani produced a solo album and discusses her fears in leaving No Doubt for a solo career as well as her desire to have a baby. "
945002	Rich Girl" was released as the album's second single.
945003	A duet with rapper Eve, and produced by Dr. Dre, it is an adaptation of a 1990s pop song by British musicians Louchie Lou & Michie One, which itself is a cover of "If I Were a Rich Man", from the musical Fiddler on the Roof. "
945004	Rich Girl" proved successful on several formats, and reached the US and UK top ten.
945005	L.A.M.B.'s third single "Hollaback Girl" became Stefani's first US and second Australian number-one single; it was less successful elsewhere.
945006	The song was the first US digital download to sell more than one million copies legally, and its brass-driven composition remained popular throughout 2005.
945007	The fourth single "Cool" was released shortly following the popularity of its predecessor, but failed to match its chart success, reaching the top twenty in US and UK.
945008	The song's lyrics and its accompanying music video, filmed in Lake Como, Italy, depict Stefani's former relationship with Kanal. "
945009	Luxurious" was released as the album's fifth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. "
945010	Crash "was released in early 2006 as the album's sixth single in lieu of Love Angel Music Baby....'s sequel, which Stefani postponed because of her pregnancy.
945011	Stefani's second solo album, The Sweet Escape, was recorded by Guy Charbonneau's Le Mobile Remote Recording Studio and released in December 2006.
945012	Stefani recollaborated with Kanal, Perry, and The Neptunes, along with Akon and Tim Rice-Oxley from English rock band Keane.
945013	The album focuses more heavily on electronic and dance music for clubs than its predecessor.
945014	Stefani commented that it differed from L.A.M.B. because "I just wasn't inspired to do another album and... I was a lot more relaxed making it."
945015	Its release coincided with the DVD release of Stefani's first tour, entitled Harajuku Lovers Live.
945016	The album received mixed reviews by critics, who found that it "has a surprisingly moody, lightly autobiographical feel... [but] Stefani isn't convincing as a dissatisfied diva" and called the album a "hasty return" that repeats Love. Angel. Music. Baby. with less energy.
946000	"Wind It Up", the album's lead single, was panned by critics for its use of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, reaching the top twenty in most markets.
946001	The title track was well received.
946002	To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon.
946003	It became Stefani's most successful song of her solo career and earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.
946004	In November 2006, the club single "Yummy" was released as a three-track maxi promo single and as a 12" vinyl single, both featuring a radio edit, an instrumental and an a cappella version of the song. "
946005	4 in the Morning" was released as the album's third single.
946006	The album's fourth single was a hybrid version of "Now That You Got It" which featured Damian Marley. "
946007	Early Winter" was released in February 2008 with initial success on European charts.
946008	To promote the album, Stefani embarked a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour.
946009	The tour covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America.
946010	In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated that she had no plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, "That was a moment in time [...] It went on a little longer than we all thought it would, because it was inspired and you have to go with wherever you're at in that time in your life... [But] everything works out how it should."
946011	With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began initial work on a new album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani's The Sweet Escape Tour was finished.
946012	In March 2008, the band started making posts concerning the progression of the album on their official fan forum.
946013	Stefani made a post on March 28, 2008 stating that songwriting had commenced but was slow on her end because she was, at the time, pregnant with her second child.
946014	The Singles 1992-2003 became available on December 9, 2008 for the video game Rock Band 2.
946015	All members of No Doubt except for Stefani served as Scott Weiland's backing band on the album "Happy" in Galoshes.
946016	No Doubt announced on their official website they wanted to tour in 2009 while finishing their upcoming album, which was set for release 2010.
946017	On November 24, 2008, it was announced that No Doubt would be headlining the Bamboozle 2009 festival in May, along with Fall Out Boy.
946018	The band completed a national tour in the summer of 2009.
946019	In 2010 they resumed writing their record which was recorded in 2011.
946020	The leading single "Settle Down" was released in July.
946021	The album Push and Shove was released on September 25, 2012 in the United States.
947000	In late summer 2007, Stefani launched a perfume, L, as a part of her L.A.M.B. collection of clothing and accessories.
947001	The perfume has high notes of sweet pea and rose.
947002	In September 2008, Stefani released a fragrance line as a part of her Harajuku Lovers product line.
947003	There are five different fragrances based on the four Harajuku Girls and Stefani herself called Love, Lil' Angel, Music, Baby and G (Gwen). As of January 2011, Stefani has become the spokesperson for L'Oréal Paris.
947004	In 2004, Stefani showed interest in making film appearances and began auditioning for films such as Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
947005	She made her acting debut playing Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator in 2004 and was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture the following year.
947006	Scorsese, whose daughter was a No Doubt fan, showed reciprocal interest in casting Stefani after seeing her picture from a Marilyn Monroe-inspired photo shoot for Teen Vogue in 2003.
947007	To prepare for the role, Stefani read two biographies and watched eighteen of Harlow's films.
947008	Shooting her part took four to five days, and Stefani had few lines.
947009	Stefani lent her voice to the title character of the 2004 video game Malice; before completion, however, the company opted not to use No Doubt band members' voices.
947010	Stefani made most of the clothing that she wore on stage with No Doubt, resulting in increasingly eclectic combinations.
947011	Stylist Andrea Lieberman introduced her to haute couture clothing, which led to Stefani launching a fashion line named L.A.M.B. in 2004.
947012	The line takes influence from a variety of fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles.
947013	The line achieved popularity among celebrities and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself.
947014	In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as "a glorified merchandise line", with varied products including a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments.
947015	In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called "Love Angel Music Baby.... Fashion dolls". The dolls are inspired by the various costumes that Stefani and the Harajuku Girls wore while touring for the album.
948000	Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating.
948001	Stefani stated that she was heavily invested in the relationship, commenting that "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would let me have a baby with him."
948002	During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal.
948003	Kanal ended the relationship.
948004	Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of the album's songs, such as "Don't Speak", "Sunday Morning", and "Hey You", chronicle the ups and downs of their relationship.
948005	During mid-1995, No Doubt and rock band Goo Goo Dolls went on tour opening for alternative rock band Bush.
948006	Stefani met Bush guitarist and lead singer Gavin Rossdale.
948007	They married on September 14, 2002, with a wedding in St Paul's, Covent Garden, London.
948008	A second wedding was held in Los Angeles two weeks later.
948009	According to Stefani, it was held so that she could wear her custom-designed wedding dress by John Galliano twice.
948010	A paternity test in 2004 revealed that Rossdale had a daughter, Daisy Lowe (who was fifteen years old then), from a previous relationship with model and designer Pearl Lowe.
948011	Stefani was "devastated and infuriated" at the discovery, leading to a rocky patch in her relationship with Rossdale.
948012	Rossdale remains Daisy's godfather and has a somewhat friendly relationship her.
948013	Stefani's song "Danger Zone" was widely believed to be about the discovery and its aftermath, which has proven to be impossible because the song was written prior to the incident.
948014	In December 2005, Stefani and Rossdale announced that they were expecting their first child together.
948015	The pregnancy was first reported by Us Weekly, and Stefani confirmed the pregnancy by shouting, "I want you to sing so loud that the baby hears it!"
948016	during a concert in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after her press agent stated that it was untrue.
948017	On May 26, 2006, their son, Kingston James McGregor Rossdale, was born via Caesarean section at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
948018	Kingston weighed 3.4 kg (7 lb 8 oz). In January 2008, it was confirmed by her father-in-law that Stefani would be expecting her second child.
948019	The couple's second son, Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale, was born August 21, 2008 at 12:46 pm.
949000	Stefani's unusual and dynamic vocals have been noted for their "deep vibrato" and Stefani has been described as having a "unique vocal prowess". The Chicago Tribune stated that Stefani had a "brash alto."
949001	In the single "Cool", her vocal range covers around one and a half octaves.
949002	Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times joked that as Stefani grew as a musician, she kicked her "addiction" to vibrato.
949003	Stefani received five nominations at the 2006 Grammy Awards, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album.
949004	Stefani has been influenced by and compared to pop singer Madonna.
949005	In 2007, she told Elle magazine, "A lot of my influence came from her early work, like directly, like a Xerox."
949006	However, Madonna told a reporter that Stefani was a copycat and said that "she ripped me off", to which Stefani responded, "Some people say that I copy her. But show me one girl my age who was not influenced by her."
949007	She has been referred to as "the new Madonna" by publications such as The Hollywood Reporter and People.
949008	Some critics also saw the 1980s music style of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. as another way which Stefani was imitating the singer.
949009	Stefani began wearing a bindi in the mid-1990s after attending several family gatherings for Tony Kanal, who is of Indian heritage.
949010	During No Doubt's breakthrough, Stefani wore the forehead decoration in several of the band's music videos and briefly popularized the accessory in 1997.
949011	First attracting attention in the 1995 music video for "Just a Girl", Stefani is known for her midriff and frequently wears shirts that expose it.
949012	Stefani's makeup design generally includes light face powder, bright red lipstick, and arched eyebrows; she wrote about the subject in a song titled "Magic's in the Makeup" for No Doubt's Return of Saturn, asking "If the magic's in the makeup/Then who am I?".
949013	Stefani is a natural brunette, though her hair has not been its natural color since she was in ninth grade.
949014	Since late 1994, she has had platinum blond hair.
949015	Stefani discussed this in the song "Platinum Blonde Life" on Rock Steady and played original blond bombshell Jean Harlow in the 2004 biopic The Aviator.
949016	Stefani also dyed her hair blue in 1998 and pink in 2000, appearing on the cover of Return of Saturn with pink hair.
950000	In 2006, Stefani modified her image, inspired by that of Michelle Pfeiffer's character in the 1983 film Scarface.
950001	The reinvented image included a symbol consisting of two back-to-back G's, which appears on a diamond-encrusted key she wears on a necklace and which became a motif in the promotion of The Sweet Escape.
950002	Stefani raised concerns in January 2007 about her rapid weight loss following her pregnancy.
950003	She stated she lost the weight through diet and exercise but admitted to obsessing over her weight due to the size zero trend.
950004	She later stated that she had been on a diet since the sixth grade to fit in size 4 clothing, commenting, "It's an ongoing battle and it's a nightmare. But I like clothes too much, and I always wanted to wear the outfits I would make."
950005	A wax figure of Stefani was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas at The Venetian on September 22, 2010.
950006	The release of Stefani's first solo album brought attention to her entourage of four Harajuku Girls, named for the area around the Harajuku Station of Tokyo, Japan.
950007	Stefani treats the back-up dancers, who appear in outfits influenced by Gothic Lolita fashion, as a figment of her imagination.
950008	Stefani's clothing also took influence from Japanese fashion, in a style described as a combination between Christian Dior and Japan.
950009	The dancers are featured in her music videos, press coverage, and on the album cover for Love. Angel. Music. Baby.,
950010	with a song named for and dedicated to them on the album.
950011	They were also featured in, and the namesake for, Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005.
950012	Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Stefani donated $1 million to Save the Children's Japan Earthquake-Tsunami Children in Emergency Fund.
950013	Stefani also ran an auction on eBay from April 11 to April 25, 2011, allowing participants to bid on vintage clothing items from her personal wardrobe and custom T-shirts designed and signed by her, as well as on admission to a private Harajuku-themed tea party hosted by her on June 7, 2011 at Los Angeles' first-ever Japanese-style maid café and pop art space, Royal/T, with proceeds from the auction going to Save the Children's relief effort.
950014	At the amfAR gala during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Stefani auctioned off the lacy black dress she wore at the event for charity, raising over $125,000.
950015	The dress sparked controversy after a representative for designer Michael Angel-who helped Stefani with the design and worked as a stylist-alleged that it was Angel who created the gown, not Stefani.
950016	In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala, adding, "I'm disappointed that the focus has shifted away from what Gwen and I originally intended, which was to create a custom outfit for a great cause. We both were thrilled with the outcome and enjoyed the process. I have nothing but respect for her and look forward to working with her on more projects in the future."
950017	Stefani hosted a fundraiser with First Lady Michelle Obama in August 2012 at the singer's Beverly Hills home.
953000	In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund.
953001	Young Vivian made her first stage appearance at the age of three, reciting "Little Bo Peep" for her mother's amateur theatre group.
953002	Gertrude tried to instill in her daughter an appreciation of literature and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore.
953003	At the age of six, Vivian Hartley was sent to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) in Roehampton, south-west London, from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, by her mother.
953004	One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become "a great actress". She was removed from the school by her father, who took her travelling in Europe with schools in the areas they travelled providing her schooling.
953005	They returned to Britain in 1931.
953006	She attended one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress.
953007	Her father enrolled her at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.
953008	Vivian Hartley met Herbert Leigh Holman., known as Leigh Holman, a barrister thirteen (13) years her senior, in 1931.
953009	Despite his disapproval of "theatrical people", they wed on 20 December 1932, and she terminated her studies at RADA.
953010	On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs Robin Farrington, who, decades later, would make Vivien Leigh a grandmother three times over.
953011	Leigh's friends suggested she take a small role in the film Things Are Looking Up, which marked her film debut.
953012	She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that "Vivian Holman" was not a suitable name for an actress.
953013	After rejecting his suggestion, "April Morn", she took "Vivian Leigh" as her professional name.
953014	Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential.
953015	She was cast in the play The Mask of Virtue in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles.
953016	One such article was from the Daily Express, in which the interviewer noted "a lightning change came over her face", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her.
953017	John Betjeman, the future Poet Laureate, described her as "the essence of English girlhood". Korda attended her opening-night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract, with the spelling of her name revised to "Vivien Leigh". She continued with the play; but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after.
954000	In 1960, Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, "some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him."
954001	Laurence Olivier saw Leigh in The Mask of Virtue, and a friendship developed after he congratulated her on her performance.
954002	Olivier and Leigh began an affair after acting as lovers in Fire Over England (1937), when Olivier was married to actress Jill Esmond.
954003	During this time, Leigh read the Margaret Mitchell novel Gone with the Wind and instructed her American agent to suggest her to David O. Selznick, who was planning a film version.
954004	She remarked to a journalist, "I've cast myself as Scarlett O'Hara"; and The Observer film critic C.A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh "stunned us all" with the assertion that Olivier "won't play Rhett Butler, but I shall play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see."
954005	Despite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark.
954006	Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage.
954007	Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him, before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space.
954008	She was able to perform without mishap; and, by the following day, she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event.
954009	It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her.
954010	They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce.
954011	Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.
954012	Leigh appeared with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), the first of her films to receive attention in the United States.
954013	During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable; and Korda instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve.
954014	Her next role was in St. Martin's Lane (1938) with Charles Laughton.
955000	Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career.
955001	He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed.
955002	Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London.
955003	Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella; but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.
955004	Hollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's production of Gone with the Wind (1939). Leigh's American theatrical agent was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency (Myron was David's brother). In February 1938, Leigh asked that she be allowed to play Scarlett O'Hara.
955005	Selznick, who watched her performance that month in Fire Over England and A Yank at Oxford, thought her to be excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett, as she was "too British". Leigh travelled to Los Angeles to be with Olivier and to try to convince Selznick that she was Scarlett.
955006	When Myron Selznick, who also represented Olivier, met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities his brother was searching for.
955007	According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and introduced Leigh, telling his brother, "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara."
955008	The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test and wrote to his wife, "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's "incredible wildness"; she secured her role as Scarlett soon after.
956000	Filming proved difficult for Leigh.
956001	Cukor was dismissed and replaced by Victor Fleming, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled.
956002	She and Olivia de Havilland secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts.
956003	She befriended Clark Gable, his wife Carole Lombard and Olivia de Havilland; but she clashed with Leslie Howard, with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes.
956004	Leigh was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress; and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York.
956005	She said to Laurence Olivier on a long-distance call, "Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!"
956006	In a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of Leigh's manic behaviour during the filming of Gone with the Wind: "Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on Gone with the Wind. She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York."
956007	Gone with the Wind brought Leigh immediate attention and fame; but she was quoted as saying, "I'm not a film star - I'm an actress. Being a film star - just a film star - is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvelous parts to play."
956008	The film won 10 Academy Awards including an Best Actress award for Leigh, who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.
956009	In February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Leigh, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life.
956010	Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier.
956011	Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh.
956012	On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married in Santa Barbara, California, in a ceremony attended only by their witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin.
956013	Leigh had hoped to co-star with Olivier and made a screen test for Rebecca, which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role.
956014	After viewing Leigh's screen test, Selznick noted that "she doesn't seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.
957000	Selznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor so he cast Joan Fontaine.
957001	He refused to allow her to join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself.
957002	Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars.
957003	Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.
957004	She and Olivier mounted a stage production of Romeo and Juliet for Broadway.
957005	The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the war effort.
957006	Critics were hostile in their assessment of the production.
957007	Brooks Atkinson for The New York Times wrote: "Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all."
957008	While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the "thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice."
957009	The couple had invested almost their entire savings into the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.
957010	They filmed That Hamilton Woman (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton.
957011	With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences.
957012	The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union.
957013	Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part."
957014	The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, "By Jove, she's a clinker."
958000	The Oliviers returned to Britain, and Leigh toured through North Africa in 1943.
958001	Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers.
958002	In 1944, she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered.
958003	Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, but she suffered a miscarriage.
958004	She fell into a deep depression that hit the low point when she turned on Olivier, verbally and physically attacking him until she fell to the floor, sobbing.
958005	This was the first of many major breakdowns she suffered related to bipolar disorder.
958006	Olivier came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode - several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.
958007	Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth; but her films of this period, Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) and Anna Karenina (1948), were not great successes.
958008	In 1947, Olivier was knighted; and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture.
958009	She became Lady Olivier. (
958010	After their divorce, according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.)
958011	By 1948, Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for it.
958012	Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth.
958013	The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to "charm the press."
958014	Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple, the most dramatic occurring in Christchurch when Leigh refused to go onstage.
958015	Olivier slapped her face, and Leigh slapped him in return and swore at him before she made her way to the stage.
958016	By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill; and Olivier told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses."
958017	Later, he would comment that he "lost Vivien" in Australia.
959000	The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, Antigone, included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy.
959001	Leigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct.
959002	Containing a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, the play was destined to be controversial, and the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety, but she believed strongly in the importance of the work.
959003	When the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949, J. B. Priestley denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic Kenneth Tynan commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were "too well-bred to emote effectively on stage". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious and sensationalist story, rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned; but the play also had strong supporters, among them Noël Coward who described Leigh as "magnificent."
959004	After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon engaged for the film version.
959005	Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with her co-star Marlon Brando, but she had difficulty with director Elia Kazan, who did not hold her in high regard as an actress.
959006	He later commented that "she had a small talent" but, as work progressed, he became "full of admiration" for "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance."
959007	Leigh found the role grueling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me."
959008	Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star in William Wyler's Carrie.
960000	A Streetcar Named Desire won glowing reviews for her and she won a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.
960001	Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role "everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of" but, in later years, Leigh would say playing Blanche DuBois "tipped me over into madness."
960002	In 1951, Leigh and Olivier performed two plays about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews.
960003	They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952.
960004	The reviews there were also mostly positive, but the critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own.
960005	Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments while ignoring the positive reviews of other critics.
960006	In January 1953, Leigh travelled to Ceylon to film Elephant Walk with Peter Finch.
960007	Shortly after filming commenced, she suffered a breakdown; and Paramount Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor.
960008	Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him that she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him.
960009	She gradually recovered over a period of several months.
960010	As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems.
960011	David Niven said she had been "quite, quite mad"; and in his diary Noël Coward expressed surprise that "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts."
960012	Leigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and continued on and off for several years, ultimately falling apart due to her deteriorating mental condition.
961000	In 1953, Leigh recovered sufficiently to play The Sleeping Prince with Olivier; and, in 1955, they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Macbeth, and Titus Andronicus.
961001	They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable.
961002	John Gielgud directed Twelfth Night and wrote, "...perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but not a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently ... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice."
961003	In 1955, Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak's film The Deep Blue Sea, costarring Kenneth More who felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.
961004	In 1956, Leigh took the lead role in the Noël Coward play South Sea Bubble, but she became pregnant and withdrew from the production.
961005	Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months.
961006	She joined Olivier for a European tour with Titus Andronicus, but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company.
961007	After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who continued to exert a strong influence over her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.
961008	In 1958, considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with the actor Jack Merivale, who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier he would care for her.
961009	In 1959, she achieved a success with the Noël Coward comedy Look After Lulu, with The Times critic describing her as "beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation."
962000	In 1960, she and Olivier divorced and Olivier married actress Joan Plowright.
962001	In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of problems they had experienced because of Leigh's illness: "Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness - an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble."
962002	Merivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she "would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him". Her first husband, Leigh Holman, also spent considerable time with her.
962003	Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier.
962004	Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Tovarich.
962005	She also appeared in the films The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) and Ship of Fools (1965). In May 1967, she was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance when she suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis.
962006	Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover.
962007	On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual, to perform in a play, and returned home around midnight to find her asleep.
962008	About thirty minutes later, he returned to the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor.
962009	She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, collapsed.
962010	Merivale contacted Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital.
962011	In his autobiography, Olivier described his "grievous anguish" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed.
962012	Olivier paid his respects, and "stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements.
963000	Leigh's death certificate gave her date of death as 8 July, but some references give the date as 7 July.
963001	She was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her home, Tickerage Mill, near Blackboys, East Sussex, England.
963002	A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a final tribute read by John Gielgud.
963003	In the United States, she became the first actress honoured by "The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California". The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor.
963004	Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films.
963005	When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, "People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you."
963006	Director George Cukor commented that Leigh was a "consummate actress, hampered by beauty", and Laurence Olivier said that critics should "give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty."
963007	Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses - simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired."
963008	Leigh explained that she played "as many different parts as possible" in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities.
963009	She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training.
963010	Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, "It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."
964000	Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of Gone with the Wind.
964001	In December 1939, The New York Times wrote, "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable", and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett.
964002	In 1969, critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to "the inspired casting" of Leigh, and in 1998 wrote that "she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence."
964003	Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh "brilliantly played" her role.
964004	Her performance in the West End production of A Streetcar Named Desire, described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as "proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown", led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre.
964005	Discussing the subsequent film version, Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave "two of the greatest performances ever put on film" and that Leigh's was "one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity."
964006	Kenneth Tynan ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of Titus Andronicus, commenting that she "receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber."
964007	He was one of several critics to react negatively to her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role; however, after her death he revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as "one of the worst errors of judgment" he had ever made.
964008	He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, "made more sense [...] than the usual battle-axe" portrayal of the character.
964009	In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named it as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.
965000	In 1969, a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors' Church, St Paul's, Covent Garden, London.
965001	In 1985, a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate "British Film Year". In April 2013 she was again included in a series of U.K. postage stamps, this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth, achieving the rare accolade of a non-royal family member to appear on a British postage stamp on more than one occasion.
965002	London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from his estate in 1999.
965003	Known as The Laurence Olivier Archive, the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier.
965004	The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington.
965005	In 1994, the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album, monogrammed "L & V O" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia.
965006	It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia.
