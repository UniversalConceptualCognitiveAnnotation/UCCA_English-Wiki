# text = In Salon . com , Bill Wyman wrote : " Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced ; the songs , each of them , are constructed in disciplined fashion . It is his kindest album and most dismayed , and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea - plagued excesses of his mid - 1960s output and the self - consciously simple compositions of his post - accident years .
