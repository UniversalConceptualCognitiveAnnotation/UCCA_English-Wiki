# ::tok Television critics were outraged : Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote , " Mr . Presley has no discernible singing ability . ... His phrasing , if it can be called that , consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner 's aria in a bathtub . ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway . " Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music " has reached its lowest depths in the ' grunt and groin ' antics of one Elvis Presley . ... Elvis , who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar , tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos " .
