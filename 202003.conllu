# text = Sorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue , such as the " You can ' t handle the truth ! " piece from A Few Good Men and the partly Latin tirade against God in The West Wing episode " Two Cathedrals " . For television , one hallmark of Sorkin 's writer 's voice is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode , and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation .
