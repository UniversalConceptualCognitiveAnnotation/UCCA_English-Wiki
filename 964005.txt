# ::tok Kenneth Tynan ridiculed Leigh 's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of Titus Andronicus , commenting that she " receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband 's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber . " He was one of several critics to react negatively to her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955 , saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role ; however , after her death he revised his opinion , describing his earlier criticism as " one of the worst errors of judgment " he had ever made .
