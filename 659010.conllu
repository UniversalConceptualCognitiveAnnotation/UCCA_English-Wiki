# text = The songwriting duo needed an assistant who could play the keyboard : " We called someone and he could n't come , so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [ Margulies ] . Ben came to the studio , and he really could n't play the keyboards very well - he was really more of a drummer - but after that day , we kept in touch , and we sort of clicked as writers .
