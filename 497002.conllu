# text = Exploiting his androgynous appearance , the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress : taking the garment with him , he wore it during interviews — to the approval of critics , including Rolling Stone 's John Mendelsohn who described him as " ravishing , almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall " — and in the street , to mixed reaction including laughter and , in the case of one male pedestrian , producing a gun and telling Bowie to " kiss my ass " . During the tour Bowie 's observation of two seminal American proto - punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character : a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed , producing " the ultimate pop idol " . A girlfriend recalled his " scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy " , and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character " who looks like he 's landed from Mars " .
