# text = " Buckley says that Bowie " subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star " , with the result that " After Bowie there has been no other pop icon of his stature , because the pop world that produces these rock gods does n't exist any more . ... The fierce partisanship of the cult of Bowie was also unique — its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom .
