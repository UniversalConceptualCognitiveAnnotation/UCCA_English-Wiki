There was also an accent on languages , science and particularly design , where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton . In David 's account , Frampton led through force of personality , not intellect ; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither , and yielded the school 's most gifted pupils to the arts , a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son , Peter , to pursue a musical career with David , a partnership briefly intact thirty years later .
